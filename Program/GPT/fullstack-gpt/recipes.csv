Ingredients

Carrot ribbons (just use a peeler for speed)
Frozen peas
Red cabbage
Yellow peppers
Red onion

1 tsp miso paste
1 tsp of Chinese five spice
2 tbsp of soy sauce
1 tbsp of oil
100g white rice

","
Method

Cook the rice as instructed on the packaging.


While the rice cooks, prep the vegetables. I like a mix of diced, ribbon, julienne to create a mix of textures.


When the veg is ready, add the oil to a frying pan or wok and let it get hot before throwing in the veg. Carrots and cabbage take a little longer to cook so I put them in first and then the rest of the veg goes in a couple of minutes later.


Keep giving the veg a stir and turning it over so it cooks evenly and doesn’t stick. It should take 5 – 10 mins to cook through.


Add the miso, five spice and soy sauce and stir through. Finally, add the rice. Stir regularly so it doesn’t burn. Once the rice is heated through, you are good to go.

5,https://veganuary.com/recipes/chilli-vegetable-pizza/,Chilli Vegetable Pizza,"
Ingredients

125g ’00’ flour
125g strong wholemeal flour
1/2 tsp dried active yeast*
4g dried chipotle mora chilli
very finely diced
5g Himalayan pink salt (or table salt)
150ml warm water
12 cherry tomatoes
1/2 red onion
1 large clove garlic
7g ancho poblano chilli
soaked with seeds
1/2 cup water
2 tblsps balsamic vinegar

","
Preparation
Makes 2 individual 8″ pizzas
Equipment

Food processor with dough blade
Pizza stone or tray
Measuring cups
Measuring spoons
Frying pan


Method
Add all of the flours, yeast*, salt and chipotle mora to the food processor with the dough blade and turn on.
*I only had dried active yeast to hand, so added it to the ingredients above, (ignoring the actual instructions on the container) with full success!
Pour the water in a steady trickle until you’ve used it all and the dough becomes a ball.
Take the dough out of the processor, lightly flour your surface and set the timer for 10 mins. Knead and stretch the dough the whole time – if your arms start to ache, just image the amazing workout you’re giving them without stepping inside a gym!
Once the timer goes off, shape into a ball, put into a deep bowl that’s had a light sprinkling of flour on the bottom, cover with cling film and leave to rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Once rested, take it out of the bowl and knead again for 10 seconds – this helps to develop the flavour and the gluten.
Divide into 2 equally sized, smooth balls of dough and put into a deep baking dish, lightly sprinkled with flour. Make sure the dish is big enough for them to spread up to twice their size because as the gluten relaxes, they will spread to some degree.
* Top Tip *
I’ve made this base numerous times and sometimes the dough spreads a lot, other times it hardly spreads at all. Don’t worry, it’s always tasted great either way!
Leave to rest at room temperature overnight, or if you’re in a massive hurry, at least eight hours! I don’t leave mine in a very warm place like the airing cupboard as I found it can dry out and form a ‘skin’ on the outside.
* Top Tip *
The resting time for the dough is ideally 24 hours, but 48 hours is maximum.
Put the normal blade back into your food processor and add in the tomatoes, onion, garlic and ancho poblano, pulse for 10-20 seconds to break them up into small chunks, and pour into your frying pan.
* Top Tip *
You can choose how chunky or smooth to have the sauce when pulsing in the processor. Personally I prefer it chunky as it almost becomes one of the delicious pizza toppings.
Add the water, balsamic and simmer on a medium heat for 12-15 mins to let the flavours intensify, while stirring occasionally. It’s ready when the excess liquid has been absorbed but it’s still moist; don’t let it dry out and stick to the pan.
* Top Tip *
The sauce flavours will develop the longer you leave it, so why not make it a couple of days in advance and keep in the fridge? It does however, also tastes great if you make it on the day.
Turn the oven on to the highest setting to heat up your pizza stone if you have one, otherwise 220c if you’re using a pizza tray.
* Top Tip *
For pizza stones, it’s always the hotter the better, so I usually pre-heat mine for an hour.
Lightly flour your surface, roll out the dough, add sauce and your favourite tasty toppings. Put into the oven for approx. 8 mins on the pizza stone. I haven’t cooked them on a pizza tray before, but as it won’t have the intense heat of the stone, I’d suggest 10-12 mins (keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn’t overcook on top).
* Serving Suggestion *
These chilli pizzas are a spicy alternative to your usual takeaway version – the base has a delicious hot and smokey bite to it, yet this is balanced perfectly by the sweet flavours of the tomato sauce. Throw a pizza party and impress your friends with your cooking skills, or snuggle up on the sofa with your loved one and enjoy all to yourselves!
I honestly don’t miss cheese on pizza once I throw on a mix of veggies, Dee’s vegan sausage and lots of hot, sweet roquito peppers – what’s on your list of ultimate pizza toppings?

Ingredients

For the shortcrust pastry:
150g plain gluten-free flour
75g dairy-free soya spread
2 tsp agave nectar or maple syrup
75ml cold water
For the filling:
30g dairy-free soya spread
3 tbsp agave nectar or maple syrup
25g plain gluten-free flour
50g ground almonds
3  Nākd Bakewell Tart Bars
Flaked almonds, for decorating

","
Preparation
Serves:  20
Preparation time: 15 minutes, plus 15 minutes chilling
Cooking time: 15 minutes

Method

Heat the oven to 170c and lightly grease a mini muffin tin.
Make the pastry by sifting the flour into the bowl of a food processor and adding the soya spread. Blend until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Alternatively, mix together in a bowl using your fingertips. Transfer the mixture to a separate bowl and stir in the agave nectar/maple syrup and a small amount of water at a time until a smooth dough comes together. Wrap it in cling film and leave in the fridge for 15 minutes, whilst you prepare the filling.
Make an almond Frangipane by creaming the dairy-free spread and agave nectar/maple syrup together, then adding the gluten-free flour and ground almonds, mixing until well combined.
Once the dough has chilled, roll it out between two sheets of cling film to about 1/4cm thickness. Use a cookie cutter or upside down glass to cut out pastry shells to fit into the mini muffin tin.
Start filling the shells with bits of the Nākd Bakewell Tart bars, by rolling them into small discs to fill the bottom of the shell, coming up a third of the way.
Spoon the Frangipane mixture on top and flatten with your finger to create a smooth top. Decorate with the flaked almonds and brush the tops with a little dairy-free milk.
Bake for 15 minutes, turning half way to ensure an even bake. Leave to cool and enjoy!

9,https://veganuary.com/recipes/non-dairy-garlic-herb-gournay/,Non-Dairy Garlic Herb Gournay,"
Ingredients

½ block (7 oz) extra-firm water-packed tofu (not silken tofu)
3 tbsp organic refined coconut oil
1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
1 tsp white wine vinegar or raw apple cider vinegar
1 to 2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tsp dried parsley
2 tsp dried minced chives
1 tsp dried basil
1 tsp fine sea salt or kosher salt
½ tsp onion powder
½ tsp coarse ground black pepper
¼ tsp dried thyme leaves
Plain unsweetened non-dairy milk to adjust consistency as needed*

","
Preparation
*Homemade almond or cashew milk is ideal because of its creamy consistency and ability to minimize the chalky undertaste of the tofu.

Method
Press the tofu to remove as much moisture as possible and then crumble into a food processor.
Remove the metal lid from the jar of coconut oil and place the jar in a microwave. Heat just until the solid oil liquefies, about 30 seconds to 1 minute (this will depend upon the solidity of the coconut oil). Alternately, place the jar in about an inch of simmering water and melt the oil in the same manner. Measure 3 tablespoons and add to the food processor with the remaining ingredients. Process the contents until very smooth.
Transfer the mixture to a container with a lid. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 6 hours to allow the flavors to blend and the cheese to firm. If desired, transfer the cheese to a decorative container and allow the cheese to soften for about 15 minutes at room temperature before serving. Gournay should be thick, yet spreadable. If the cheese is dry and crumbly, stir in small amounts of non-dairy milk until the desired consistency is achieved.

14,https://veganuary.com/recipes/butternut-squash-and-sage-lasagne/,Butternut Squash and Sage Lasagne,"
Ingredients

For the butternut ‘pasta’:
1 butternut squash
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp maple syrup
8 sage leaves (fresh)
Black pepper
For the tomato sauce:
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp smoked paprika
½ tsp cinnamon
6 cloves garlic
1 red chilli
1 red onion
250g chestnut mushrooms
4 medium tomatoes (you could also use a tin of chopped tomatoes; cooking time will be less)
2 tsp red pepper / tomato puree
125 ml red wine
1 tbsp vinegar (red wine or balsamic)
Black pepper
For the white sauce:
1 tsp olive oil
3 cloves garlic
½ tsp turmeric
½ tsp cumin
1 tbsp coconut flour
125 ml non-dairy milk
350g silken firm tofu
1 tbsp lemon juice
3 tbsp nutritional yeast
1 tsp wholegrain mustard
Himalayan pink salt, to taste
250g baby spinach
2 vegan sausages (such as Field Roast, Chipotle flavour) sliced into thin discs
Handful of grated vegan cheese

","
Method

Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
To prepare the butternut, begin by peeling with a sharp knife. I find the easiest way to do this is to first slice off the ends, followed by cutting it in half across the middle. You can now slice the skin off from top to bottom on each half. Once peeled, cut each half lengthways through the middle and scoop the seeds and stringy bits from the bottom half. Now slice each segment thinly, so you have lots of half crescent ‘pasta’ sheets.
Lay the butternut slices on an oven tray and drizzle over the olive oil and maple syrup. Chop the sage leaves into 1cm wide ribbons and sprinkle these on with some black pepper. Cook in the oven for 25 minutes.
While the butternut slices are cooking, prepare the tomato sauce. Finely chop the red onion, garlic and chilli and chop the mushrooms into quarters. Heat the olive oil on a medium heat in a large pan and add the spices: cooking these first releases the flavours. Add the onion, garlic, chilli and mushrooms and cook for about 10 minutes (or when slightly browned and soft).
Chop the tomatoes into small chunks and add these to the pan with the pepper/tomato paste, red wine and vinegar. Simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until reduced. It should be thick, but still loose. Add the black pepper towards the end of cooking.
While the tomato sauce is reducing you can make the white sauce. Heat the olive oil on a medium heat in a saucepan and add the spices and garlic. Keep an eye on the garlic – you want it to brown lightly but not burn. Once the garlic has begun to colour stir in the flour – much like making a roux for a béchamel sauce. Stir for a minute and then add the milk to create a sauce, continuing to stir. Next, add the tofu and mash it into the sauce using the back of the spoon. You can now stir in the remaining ingredients and leave to simmer for 10 minutes. Again, it should be thick but loose.
Finally, wilt the spinach by putting it in a pan on a low heat. Give it a stir and drain the water- this only takes about 5 minutes.
Now for the assembly! Layer the ingredients in a deep dish or tin. I put mine together in the following order: tomato sauce, white sauce, spinach and sausage slices, butternut squash. Repeat until you have used all the ingredients and finish with a sprinkling of cheese.
Cook in the oven for 20 minutes, or until the top is nice and crisp. Let it stand for 5 minutes before serving, so that the layers hold their shape.
Wonderful! Serve with steamed greens and a Miso dressing, which work really well as a contrasting tang to all of the earthy flavours of the lasagne.

"
15,https://veganuary.com/recipes/shepherds-pie/,Shepherd’s Pie,"
Ingredients

8-10 potatoes peeled
2 medium onions
2 large carrots
10 button mushrooms (or equivalent)
4 stalks of celery
2 garlic cloves
200g brown or green lentils (dry)
2 tbsp fresh parsley
1 big teaspoon of mixed herbs (feel free to use more if you want)
½ – 1 teaspoon of cinnamon (yes you read right – cinnamon)
1 tbsp plain flour
1 tbsp soya butter
1 tbsp tomato puree
1 vegetable stock cube
500ml boiling water
Salt and pepper

","
Preparation
Soak your lentils in advance (2/3 hours before cooking ideally).

Method

Soak your lentils in water for 2/3 hours before you start cooking. If you don’t do this they will take a lot longer to cook.


Peel, wash and put your potatoes on to boil.


Finely dice your onions, carrots, celery and mushrooms and crush your garlic.


Put a casserole pot on a medium heat and add your soya butter.


When melted add the onions and sweat them off until they start to go translucent.


Add the garlic and sweat until both the onion and garlic are soft and translucent.


Add the rest of the veg and cook for another 10 minutes – stirring constantly.


When the veg has softened and started to brown add in your flour and stir through so it coats the veg.


Then add the flavourings – salt, pepper, cinnamon, mixed herbs and parsley. Stir these through.


Make 500ml of stock using your water and vegetable stock cube.


Mix the tomato puree into the stock.


Then start adding your stock to the veg very slowly. Every time your pour some stock into the veg stir it through until it has absorbed and slightly thickened.


Then drain your lentils and them to the pot and stir through.


If this makes the mixture too dry add some more boiling water in small amounts. If you need to add a lot of water you can throw in another half a stock cube so you don’t dilute all the flavour.


Leave the mixture to simmer for around 40-45 minutes but check it and stir it constantly to make sure it doesn’t burn. Keep the heat low to avoid this happening.


Add in a about a tablespoon of brown sauce at the end of the cooking process and stir it though.


When the lentil mix is cooked through add it to your baking dish.


Mash your potatoes with soya butter and unsweetened soya milk or another plant milk (I would not recommend anything sweet or almond milk).


Spread the mashed potato over the top of the lentil mix, smoothing it out with a fork. We added some parsley on top.


If you have any Violife cheese you could add this over the top but that is optional.


Then bake the shepherd’s pie a hot oven for 20-30 minutes until the potato starts to go golden brown. If you don’t bake it until the following day it will need longer.


When it’s ready put your hands together and give thanks that NO animal was harmed in the making of your dinner and enjoy!

1 large aubergine
1 red pepper
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 small onion
5 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
150g mushrooms, sliced
1 teaspoon ground coriander
a large pinch of ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon ground cumin
¹⁄³ teaspoon chilli powder
½ teaspoon sea salt
½ teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon dried basil
2 tomatoes, grated
½ a handful of fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped
4 wholewheat flatbreads
juice of ½ a lemon For the topping
1 x lemon tofu feta (optional)
5 tablespoons cashews, roughly chopped

","
Preparation

Pierce the aubergine many times with a fork, then put it on a baking tray with the red pepper and rub them both with olive oil. Bake in the oven – check the pepper after 15 minutes, then turn them both over with a spatula and bake for 15 minutes more. Take out the pepper and leave the aubergine in for another 10 minutes. They should both be soft and well coloured. Deseed the pepper, trim the aubergine, and roughly chop them both.


While that is going on, on a medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of oil in a frying pan. Add the onions and fry for 6–8 minutes, then add the garlic, mushrooms, spices, salt and pepper, and continue cooking for 3–4 minutes. Add a splash more oil if needed. Now add the red pepper and aubergine, with the basil and tomatoes, and warm through on a low simmer for 6–7 minutes more. Stir in the parsley, cover and keep warm.


Your oven should still be rocking. Bring it back to 200°C/gas mark 6, lay out your flatbreads on baking trays and brush them with olive oil (especially the edges). Spread the vegetable mixture thinly over the bread – 4 tablespoons per lakmajun is normally cool. Top with cashews and tofu feta (if you’re using it) and pop into the oven for 12–15 minutes.


Serve drizzled with a little more olive oil and even a little squeeze of lemon juice. Depending on the size of the flatbread, this dish makes a great little or big plate and can be cut into wedges to be served as an appetizer or rolled around some salad. Raw cashew hummus (see page 160) is a perfect accompaniment.

21,https://veganuary.com/recipes/vegan-hot-cross-buns/,Hot Cross Buns,"
Ingredients

1tbsp ground flaxseed
300ml plant-based milk
50g vegan margarine
500g strong bread flour
1tsp salt
75g caster sugar
1tbsp sunflower oil
7g sachet fast-action yeast
75g sultanas
50g mixed peel
zest of 1 orange
1 apple, peeled, cored and finely chopped
1tsp ground cinnamon
75g plain flour
3tbsp apricot jam

","
Method

Make a flax egg by combining 1tbsp ground flaxseed with 3tbsp warm water. Give it a good whisk and let it stand for 15 minutes.
Bring the plant-based milk to the boil, then add the vegan margarine. Leave it to cool just enough that you can comfortably dip a finger in. Put the bread flour, salt, sugar and yeast in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Pour in the warm milk mixture, then add the flax egg. Mix well with a wooden spoon, then bring everything together with your hands until you have a dough.
Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5 minutes. You want the dough to look smooth and elastic. Put the dough in an oiled bowl and cover with oiled cling film or a clean tea towel. Leave it to rise in a warm place for about an hour, or until it has doubled in size.
Tip in the sultanas, peel, orange zest, apple and cinnamon. Knead the fruit into the dough. Cover again with cling film or a tea towel and let it stand for another hour.
Divide the dough into about 15 pieces and roll each one into a ball. Arrange the buns on a lined baking tray leaving room between each one so it can expand. Cover and let them stand for another hour.
Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Mix the plain flour with 5tbsp water and mix into a dough. Pinch off lumps of this dough and roll into long strips. Drape these over your buns in a cross shape. Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes, or until the buns are golden-brown on top.
Heat the jam until it melts. Take the buns out of the oven and spread the hot jam on top to make a glaze. Leave them to cool.

24,https://veganuary.com/recipes/courgette-potato-sujebi-pulled-noodles/,Courgette and Potato Sujebi (pulled noodles),"
Ingredients

½ Courgette
2 Potatoes
200g Flour
1/3 Carrot
1 Green Chilli
1 Red Chilli
3 Soaked Shiitake Mushrooms
Radish
Ready-cut Kelp (for vegetable stock only)
A pinch of salt
Naturally Brewed Soy Sauce
Sesame Seeds

","
Method

Steam or boil the potatoes and mash once they are soft enough.
Add the flour and a pinch of salt to the mashed potatoes and mix to make a batter. Add water if needed. Leave the batter to rest in a plastic bag or a layer of wet cloth.
While waiting, prepare a vegetable stock by boiling the shiitake mushrooms, radish and ready-cut kelp. Once cooked, remove the mushrooms, chop into bite-sized pieces and place back into the stock. Remove the kelp to use as a topping later.
Cut the courgette and carrot into half-moon shaped pieces. Finely chop or mince the chillies and mix them with a small amount of soy sauce, sesame seeds and salt to taste.
Hand-pull the batter into flat, bite-sized pieces, add to the stock and bring to a boil.

25,https://veganuary.com/recipes/chocolate-fudge-cake/,Chocolate Fudge Cake,"
Ingredients

260g self-raising flour
40g cocoa powder
2 teaspoons of baking powder
1/2 teaspoon of salt
200g golden caster sugar
200g dairy-free spread (I use Pure Sunflower Spread)
200g plain, dairy-free chocolate (70% or more)
400ml sweetened soya milk (I used the blue Vive Soy as it has a beautiful vanilla flavour to it)
1 tablespoon of vanilla extract

Ganache filling & topping:

100g plain chocolate (70% or more)
100g icing sugar
160ml tin of coconut cream
1 tablespoon of vanilla extract
1 tablespoon of dairy-free spread

","
Method
For the cake:

Pop the oven on to 180 degrees centrigrade
Grease two 8 inch cake tins (I recommend you use springform tins if you can as these sponges have a delicate structure)
Mix the flour, cocoa powder, salt baking powder together in one bowl and set to one side
Melt the plain chocolate and whisk together with the dairy-free spread, caster sugar, soya milk, & vanilla extract
Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix with a metal spoon only until they are combined.  Warning – don’t use an electric whisk and don’t mix any longer than absolutely necessary – I really mean it when I say just enough to ensure the ingredients are combined.  Any lumps will work themselves out in the oven.  If you’re new to egg-free baking then this may seem counter-intuitive but unlike traditional baking, you want to keep air out until the cakes are in the oven.
Tap the bowl on the work surface to knock any air out of the mixture
Spoon equally into each of the cake tins
Tap each cake tin on the work surface to knock out any air you can
Place the tins in the oven for 20-25 minutes depending on your oven
Remove from the oven & test with a knife to ensure fully cooked
Leave to cool as they are for 5-10 minutes then remove the sides of the tin & leave to cool entirely
You should find that the sponges level off quite nicely so there’ll be no need to slice off the top of one but if you need to, do so with care

For the Ganache:

Melt the chocolate, coconut cream, and dairy-free spread over a low heat
Sift in the icing sugar and stir in gently until you have a smooth, glossy mixture
Leave to cool enough to be firmer but not too firm so you can still pour over the top of the finished cake
Spread some of the ganache onto the bottom sponge and gently place the second sponge on top
Once the ganache has cooled enough, pour over the cake, using a knife to spread it evenly around the sides.
Garnish as you fancy, I did so with mixed berries as you can see!

Tip: Decorate the cake on a plate so that any excess ganache is caught.  You may find it helps to pop it in the fridge to firm up the ganache so you can go back over with a knife to improve the presentation on the sides.  If you’re a real perfectionist when it comes to presentation (which I wasn’t on this occassion), a knife warmed under the hot tap will help you to achieve a smooth & glossy finish when finishing off the sides).

28,https://veganuary.com/recipes/lemon-tart/,Lemon Tart,"
Ingredients

For lemon pastry:
230g/8oz Gluten Free Plain Flour
60g/2oz dairy-free margarine – Pure Sunflower Spread
60g/2oz vegetable shortening
2 tbsp caster sugar
½ tsp xantham gum
1 tbsp lemon juice
1 – 2 tbsp cold water
The zest of 1 lemon
For the filling:
3 tbsp agar agar flakes
150g caster sugar
160ml lemon juice 
3 tbsp cornflour 
The zest of 2 lemons
60ml oat cream

","
Preparation
Serves 12
You will need a deep 8 inch tart tin with removable base for this recipe.

Method
Place the flour, xantham gum, margarine and vegetable fat in a food processor and pulse until the mixture is of a breadcrumb like consistency. Add the lemon zest and caster sugar and pulse for another minute. Tip in the lemon juice and 1 tbsp of cold water, pulsing as you go, until the mixture begins to pull together to form a dough. You can then add the extra water if you think it needs it. Turn the pastry in to a large bowl and, using the tips of your fingers, pull together into a ball.  Knead lightly for 2 minutes until smooth and elastic to your touch.  Lay the pastry between two large layers of clingfilm and roll it out – ensuring that the pastry becomes no thinner than 3mm.  Peel off the uppermost layer of clingfilm and turn the pastry in to its tin, filling in any cracks or gaps that may appear with extra pastry, patted flat with your fingertips.
Preheat the oven to 200c.  Blind bake the lemon pastry for 30 minutes, after 15 minutes remove the parchment and baking beans from the pastry and return to the oven for the remaining cooking time.  Once the pastry is cooked and lightly golden, remove from the oven and set aside to cool down.
Place the agar flakes in a high sided saucepan with 330ml of water.  Bring to the boil and leave to boil gently for 10 minutes, whisking every now and then until the agar has dissolved.  Don’t worry if the liquid foams up, this is normal and why you need to use a high sided pan.  Add the sugar to the liquid and continue to boil gently, whisking occasionally, for 3 – 4 minutes or until the sugar has dissolved into the liquid, then remove from the heat.
In a separate bowl, combine the lemon juice, zest and cornflour and stir together until smooth.  Add this mixture and the oat cream to the agar liquid and whisk together constantly, over a medium heat, for around 5 minutes or until the mixture thickens and becomes syrupy. Take off the heat and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Pour the lemon filling into the pastry tart, leave to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes and then place in the fridge to set for 1 hour.

4 tbsp Chia Seeds
1/2 cup coconut milk (depending on the thickness of the milk you use, you may need a little more or a little less)
A few drops Vanilla Extract
Cinnamon (to taste)
Pomegranate Seeds
Roasted Shaved Coconut

Method

Stir Chia, vanilla and cinnamon into the Coconut Milk and place in the refrigerator for 20 mins.


When ready to eat, add coconut shavings (raw or roasted), granola and fresh pomegranate seeds.

(When I first tried to de-pip a pomegranate, I was so frustrated; and covered with red pomegranate juice! So, just a quick tip for all pomegranate newbies – cut the pomegranate into segments and de-pip by hand in a bowl of water. The pith will float and the seeds will sink. Pour the pith and water out and you will be left with the seeds.)

Dashi Stock
An essential ingredient in macrobiotic dishes and Japanese cuisine; an earthy flavoured stock made from kombu soaking water. It’s a great base for soups, stews, sauces, noodle broths and dips.  Usually dashi is seasoned to taste with a generous serving of shoyu (natural soy sauce). Often mirin is also added, plus a little juice squeezed from a piece of grated ginger root.
To prepare a basic dashi:
Soak a six inch piece of kombu and three dried shitake, or maitake, mushrooms in about 10 cups of water for at least 15 minutes.
Remove the mushroom, and thinly slice the caps.  Discard the root as it can be bitter tasting.
Return them to the water, bring it to the boil and simmer gently for 10 minutes.
Remove the kombu and keep it to use for cooking, as a condiment, or with beans.

Ingredients

Rice – white or brown
Less than 3/4 tablespoon of coconut oil
2 tomatoes
1 fresh chilli
1 teaspoon of Jiru/cumin seeds
1/2 a teaspoon of Rye/mustard seeds
2 sweet neem leaves
A pinch of Hing/asafetida
Sweetcorn – frozen or a 340g tin
1 teaspoon of dried coriander powder
Less than 1/4 of a teaspoon of turmeric
Salt to taste
Lemon juice
1 handful of freshly chopped  coriander

","
Preparation
This recipe serves 2

Method
How to make the rice: 

Wash the rice – I usually use a small teacup of brown rice for 2 people
Add 2 & 3/4 teacups of water
Put it all in a pan on a high heat, with the lid off
When it begins to froth, put the lid on, reduce the heat as low as it can go and leave it alone for 20 minutes
After 20 minutes if there is any water left, continue to cook it for 5 minutes

How to make the Shaak:

Chop the tomatoes
Chop the chilli
Put the coconut oil in a pan, leave it on medium heat and put the lid on
When it’s hot enough add some cumin seeds, rye, sweet neem leaves and a pinch of asafetida
Put the lid on and wait until the seeds pop
When the silence in between pops is longer, add some raw peanuts, the chopped chilli and the tomatoes and put the lid back on – it may sizzle when you add the tomatoes and if it does, it’s fine
After a few minutes add the sweetcorn
Add salt to taste
Add dried coriander powder to taste
Add a pinch of turmeric
You may wish to add a squeeze of lemon juice
If you like spicy food, you may want to add some chilli powder in addition to the fresh chilli
Finally, garnish with freshly chopped coriander and your Shaak is ready

Ingredients
30g raisins
Half a red cabbage
4 sticks celery
4 spring onions, cut into shreds
Small bunch coriander
200g walnuts kernels or 75g walnuts, shelled
1 pear
For the dressing:
6 dates, or 4 if using a large variety such as the Medjool
4 tbsp walnut oil
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 tsp wholegrain mustard
1 tsp caraway seeds
","
Method
 

Place the raisins in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Place the dates in a separate bowl, cover with boiling water and set aside.
Remove the tough outer leaves from the cabbage half and cut in half through the stalk. Cut out the core from each of the two sections and then shred each piece finely along the short length.
Top and tail the spring onion and shred thinly. Chop the celery into half inch pieces.
Wash the coriander and chop leaves and stalk leaving a few whole leaves to decorate.
Roughly chop the walnut halves, again, leaving a few whole to decorate.
In a large bowl combine the cabbage, walnuts and celery.
To make the sauce, drain, stone and finely chop the softened dates. Mix in a blow along with the walnut oil, balsamic vinegar, mustard and seasoning.
Grind the caraway seeds using a pestle and mortar or spice grinder and stir into the sauce.
Core the pear and cut into slices or small chunks. If you aren’t going to serve the salad straight away then you can use a little lime or lemon juice to stop the pear from browning.
To serve, drain the raisins. Pile the cabbage mixture onto a serving platter and scatter over the raisins and coriander. Arrange the pear on top and spoon over the date and balsamic sauce.

Ingredients
Burgers and ‘buns’:

2 cartons (400g drained) cannellini beans
2 medium carrots
1 large parsnip
2 portobello mushrooms per person (or a bun of your choice)
1/3 ripe avocado per person
2 tbsp chickpea flour (can substitute for another kind of flour)
4 tbsp tomato puree
2 tbsp water
1 1/2 tbsp curry powder
1 tsp paprika powder
1 tsp chilli powder
Grind of pepper

Sweet potato fries:

1 small- medium sweet potato per person
glug of olive oil
salt & pepper

","
Method

Peel and grate the carrots and parsnip and put them on a baking tray to roast for about 5 minutes. Rinse and drain the beans, then transfer them to a bowl and mash with a fork. Add in the spices and 2 table spoons tomato puree then mash again. Next mix in the carrot, parsnip and chickpea flour. You should have a stiff dough that sticks together.
Take a handful of the mixture and shape it into a burger patty. Place on a floured baking tray. Do this until you have 6-8 burgers. Put the burgers into the oven to cook for 30 minutes, turning once.
To make the sweet potato fries peel the sweet potatoes and cut them into chip shapes. Make sure not to make them too fat otherwise they will take too long to cook! Place all of the fries on a baking tray with room between them and coat with a glug of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and put in the oven to bake for 30 minutes.
To make the ‘buns’ remove the mushroom stork and peel off the skin. Place the mushrooms on a baking tray and put it in the oven once the burgers have been cooking for 20 minutes. Turn the burgers over if you haven’t done so already. After 5 minutes turn over the mushrooms.
Mix the remaining 2 table spoons of tomato puree with two table spoons of water to make a quick tomato sauce. Then mash the avocado.
Remove the mushrooms and burgers from the oven. The mushrooms should have softened but still be able to hold the weight of the burgers. Make the burger by layering a mushroom with tomato sauce, a curried bean burger, avocado, a second burger and a mushroom.
The fries should be done by now so remove them from the oven and serve with the burgers.

","
Preparation
Serves 4 or more

Method
To make the Green Chile Cashew Cheeze

In a small saucepan, add butternut squash, cashews, garlic and 1 tablespoon salt. Cover with water and bring to a slow boil over a medium-high heat for 10 minutes until butternut is completely cooked. Remove from heat to cool, drain and add mixture to a high-speed blender.
Add in remaining ingredients (except the chilli) and blend for 3-4 minutes until wicked smooth, then add the chilli and pulse for 5 seconds to incorporate but still leave it chunky.

When you are ready to assemble the casserole

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Lightly but evenly spray a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish with oil. Layer 1/3 of the tortillas in the bottom, then top with 1/3 of the chopped chard. Combine the tomatoes, onion and parsley and layer 1/3 of that mixture, 1/4 of the green chile cashew cheeze, 1/3 of the black beans and 1/3 sliced avocado, so it’s evenly distributed. Repeat process two more times. Evenly add remaining Cashew Cream to the top and bake, uncovered, for 1 hour, or until bubbly and golden brown. Add the crumbled tortilla chips on the top and bake for an additional 5 minutes, keeping an eye on it to ensure they just turn slightly golden and do not burn.
While the casserole is baking, make the salsa pico by gently mixing all of the ingredients together in a medium bowl. Set aside.
Once bake time is done, remove casserole from the oven and let it sit for 10 – 15 minutes before serving.

To serve

Top with a few tablespoons of the fresh Salsa Pico (save some for the side) fresh cilantro, jalapeño, lime wedge and brown rice, tortilla chips and hot sauce as desired.

For the batter:
¾ cup organic peanut butter 
3 tbsp agave syrup or maple syrup
2 tbsp coconut flour
¼ teaspoon finely ground sea salt (to taste)
5 tbsp cacao nibs (or you can use rice crispies like in the original recipe)
For the coating:
3 tbsp coconut oil
3 tbsp cacao powder
3 tbsp agave
Cacao nibs for aesthetic factor (optional)

","
Preparation
Makes approximately 10 balls

Method

In a bowl mix together the peanut butter with the agave/maple syrup vigorously for 60 seconds. In this time the peanut butter should turn from quite runny to a thick consistency. The more you stir the thicker it will get.
Add in the coconut flour a little bit at a time, stirring again vigorously until you’ve got yourself a thick batter.
Warning – quite a bit of muscle is required for this step, if you’re anything like me you may need a break in between the mixing!
Add the sea salt and cacao nibs and stir until well combined.
By now the mixture should stick together quote nicely and easily be rolled into a ball
Take small spoon sized pieces from the batter, roll into individual balls and place on a tray lined with parchment paper. You should get around 10 from this mixture if you managed to refrain from “sampling” the batter
Once they’re all rolled out pop in the freezer while you prepare your chocolate mixture
In a saucepan over a very low heat melt down you coconut oil and stir in the agave and cacao making sure they’re mixed well and set off the heat allowing to cool to room temperature
With a fork, dip the balls into the melted chocolate. Tap off excess chocolate on the side of the pot and repeat for rest. (Save the leftover melted chocolate for a second layer.)
For added texture , roll the balls in cacao nibs then place on a plate or cutting board lined with parchment paper
Place back in the freezer to harden for approx. 10 minutes and repeat the chocolate dipping step to get a nice thick chocolate coating.
Place back in the freezer for another 10 minutes or until the chocolate layer is hard
Serve and enjoy!

Ingredients

2 vegan brioche bun or ciabatta buns, sliced in half and toasted or grilled lightly with a touch of olive oil or vegan butter
3 tablespoons vegan mayo mixed with 2 teaspoons of French mustard
½ beef tomato, sliced thickly
½ red onion, sliced thinly
A large handful of rocket or crispy salad leaves
½ an aubergine, sliced into ½ inch thick discs
A large glug of olive oil
1 large courgette, cut into thin strips
5 tablespoons plain flour
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
½ pint almond milk
2 Beyond Meat patties
2 tablespoons Belazu smoked semi-dried tomatoes
2 slices of Violife vegan cheddar cheese
Salt & pepper to taste

","
Method

First, prepare the aubergine: sprinkle the discs lightly with salt and leave for 30 minutes to 1 hour before patting dry with kitchen paper. Heat a grill pan or griddle on high, then toss in the aubergine slices with the olive oil. Grill until browned, roughly 3-5 minutes on each side.
Set the aubergines aside and prepare the courgette: wash, pat dry and trim the courgettes. Cut into thin chips, place in a bowl, sprinkle with salt and mix thoroughly. Then add almond milk enough to cover courgettes. Leave for 30 minutes, so they have time to release any bitter juices. If you have a deep-fat fryer, heat the oil to 180°C. If not, choose a sturdy deep saucepan with jam thermometer clipped to the side, or alternatively heat to medium low.
Pour the plain flour into a large mixing bowl. Season with a good sprinkle of salt and black pepper, and the cayenne pepper. Drain the milk from the courgettes, then toss the courgettes into the flour until they’re lightly coated. Fry for 2–3 minutes, or until golden and crisp, then tip on to crumpled kitchen paper to remove any excess oil.
Next, reheat the grill pan or griddle and grill the Beyond Meat patties until browned, roughly 2 minutes on each side.
Finally, build your burger: spread the bottom half of your sliced brioche or ciabatta with a thick layer of the mustard mayo. Add rocket, followed by the tomato, onion, grilled aubergine, Beyond Meat Patty, Violife cheddar, smoked semi-dried tomatoes and lastly the crispy courgettes. Top with the second half of the bun, press down lightly and serve immediately.

Ingredients

250 g plain flour
65 g coconut sugar 
1/3 cup coconut oil, melted see notes*
3 tbsp non-dairy milk I used oat milk
1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar
3 very ripe bananas
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp  pink salt
1/2 tsp vanilla extract


Chocolate batter
40 g cacao powder
30 g coconut sugar
3 tbsp non-dairy milk
1 tbsp coconut oil

","
Method







Pre-heat oven to 180°C/ 160°C fan and line a loaf tin with parchment paper.


To make the butter milk mix oat milk with apple cider vinegar and set aside for 5-10 minutes.


Mix plain flour, baking soda, baking powder and pink salt.


In another bowl mash 3 bananas, then mix in your coconut sugar.


Slowly mix in buttermilk and coconut oil with the mashed banana mixture.


Combine wet and dry and ingredients.


Divide the batter in half.


Add in cacao powder, coconut sugar, coconut oil and oat milk in one half of the batter. Fold until well combined.


Into a pre-lined loaf tin – pour half of the plain banana bread batter, then the chocolate banana bread batter, reserving around 3-4 tbsp. Pour in the other half of the plain batter, then dollop the remaining chocolate batter on top. To make the marbled effect grab a butter knife and swirl it into the batter in a large ‘S’ motion. Do this 2 – 3 times, no more!!


Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until you can insert a toothpick / clean knife into the middle and it comes out clean



Notes
When using melted coconut oil in any recipe with oat milk, it’s important to use room temperature milk and also slowly mix in the two when combining. If you use cold plant milk, it will cause the coconut oil to go back to its natural state and, you’ll have to re-melt the whole mixture in the microwave.

60,https://veganuary.com/recipes/tempeh-sausage-heirloom-tomatoes-black-pepper-cheezy-polenta/,Tempeh Sausage and Heirloom Tomatoes over Black Pepper Cheezy Polenta,"
Ingredients

Tempeh Sausage:
1 8oz package 3 grain tempeh
1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon liquid amino acids (we use Bragg’s)
1 ½ teaspoons fennel seeds
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black peppercorns
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning
¼ teaspoon celery seed
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
Dashes liquid smoke
1 clove garlic-minced
Black Pepper Cheezy Polenta:
4 cups water
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1 cup corn meal
2 pinches crushed black peppercorns
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
Other Ingredients:
1/4 cup white wine
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons liquid amino acids (we use Bragg’s)
1 large red onion, diced small
1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved (we used heirloom cherry tomatoes, but you don’t have to)
1 red bell pepper, chopped into bite sized pieces
1 cup raw baby spinach leaves
5 large fresh basil leaves, cut small

","
Method

In a large bowl, toss all the ingredients for the tempeh sausage. Cover and let marinate while you make your polenta.
In a Dutch oven or another large pot, bring 4 cups of water, olive oil and salt to a boil. Gradually add your corn meal to the boiling water using a whisk to blend it in. Try to break up any clumps you see start to form. Once all your corn meal is added, whisk in your pepper and nutritional yeast. Then move to stirring your polenta with a wooden spoon, be sure to scrap the sides and bottom of the pot while you stir. You’re going to be stirring pretty much continually while your polenta thickens for about 40-45 minutes. Polenta is a needy dish.
Once your polenta is soft but firm – you’ll know what I mean, put a lid on top . Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in your deepest skillet over a medium heat. Once your oil is hot, toss in your tempeh sausage mix, white wine, liquid amino acids and onions, and cook while mixing with a spatula until your tempeh has slightly crispy edges. Then toss your tomatoes and bell peppers in and let them cook for about 5 minutes, flipping them every once in a while to make sure they’re cooking evenly. Once your peppers are tender, mix in your spinach and basil leaves. Once they’re wilted, you’re done!
Serve your tempeh sausage & heirloom tomatoes over your polenta – being sure to get some of the thin “sauce” on the bottom of the skillet.

61,https://veganuary.com/recipes/baked-buckwheat-with-tomatoes/,Baked Buckwheat with Tomatoes,"
Ingredients

250 gr. Buckwheat (whole seeds)
½ stick vegan butter or margarine (plus some extra for greasing the pan)
3 3/4 cups vegetable broth
1 teaspoon curcuma
1 teaspoon dried majoram
¼ cup dried parsley
1 bunch spring onions (6-7)
5 large tomatoes (or beef tomatoes if you have)
½ cup homemade cashew parmesan
½ cup marinated tofu
For the marinated tofu:
1 package firm tofu (makes 1.5 cups tofu cubes after pressing)
1/3 cup lemon juice
1 cup olive oil
3-4 garlic cloves
½ teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon salt

","
Preparation
Prepare the marinated tofu first, a couple of days ahead would be even better. I always have a jar of this at home, it adds a little oomph to a lot of dishes.

Method
Tofu: Remove the tofu from the package and press it between several layers of paper towels. While pressing the tofu, whisk the lemon juice with salt, pepper and olive oil until the mixture turns into a smooth emulsion. Cube the dried tofu and fill the cubes in a jar. Peel the garlic cloves , cut them in halves lengthwise and add them to the tofu. Pour the lemon and olive oil mixture over the tofu cubes so they’re completely covered and close the jar with a lid. Shake the jar a little. Set aside, but not in the fridge, to let the tofu marinate. Shake occasionally to keep everything evenly covered and let it marinate as long as possible. This get’s more zingy the longer it sits.
Cashew Parmesan: Mix 1 cup roasted and salted cashews with 1/3 cup nutritional yeast and 1 teaspoon of Shiro Miso in a blender until the mixture has the texture of grated parmesan. If you use unsalted cashews, add a teaspoon of salt to the mixture. I recommend you double or triple the recipe, it keeps in the fridge and you’ll want to use it in other dishes, too.
Roast the buckwheat with half of the vegan butter or margarine in a pot. Add the broth, curcuma, majoram and parsley. Close the lid and let the mixture simmer on small heat for 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 200C/390F.
Turn off the heat under the buckwheat and let it soak for another 10 minutes. Meanwhile, clean the spring onions, top and tail and cut them in fine rings. Scald and peel the tomatoes and remove the core. Grease an oven-proof casserole dish and place the tomatoes top down in the dish. Mix spring onions, buckweat and cashew parmesan and distribute the mixture evenly around the tomatoes.
Crumble the marinated tofu with a fork, mix the crumbles with 2 tablespoons of the marinade and sprinkle the dish with the tofu and marinade mixture.
Bake for 30 minutes at 200C/390F.
Serve with tomato and cucumber salad and soy yogurt or vegan sour cream.
Guten Appetit!

½ teaspoon saffron strands
1 litre vegetable stock
240g (2 cups) shelled broad (fava) beans
100g (2/3 cup) fine green beans, topped and tailed and halved
100g (2/3 cup) fine asparagus, cut into 5cm lengths
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
200g (1 1/3 cup) small courgettes (zucchini), cut into thick slices
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 large red pepper, deseeded and chopped into 1cm pieces
1 large green pepper, deseeded and chopped into 1cm pieces
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 teaspoon sweet pimentón
200g (1 cup) tomatoes, fresh or from a can, skinned and chopped
400g (2 cups) short grain paella rice, such as Calasparra or Bomba
2 tablespoons freshly chopped flatleaf parsley
100g (1/2 cup) shelled peas
280g jar chargrilled artichokes in olive oil, drained
fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

","
Method

Shake the saffron strands around in a slightly hot frying pan for a few seconds until dry but not coloured, then tip into a small mortar or coffee cup and grind to a powder with the pestle or a wooden spoon. Add a splash of the stock and set aside.
Bring a pan of salted water to the boil. Drop in the broad beans, bring back to the boil and cook for 2 minutes. Lift out with a slotted spoon into a colander, leave to drain, then tip into a bowl.
Bring the pan of water back to the boil, add the green beans and cook for 3 minutes. Remove with the slotted spoon to the colander and refresh under cold water. Tip onto a plate.
Bring the water back to the boil once more, add the asparagus, bring back to the boil, drain and refresh under cold water. Pop the broad beans out of their skins and add to the plate of green beans with the asparagus.
Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan or shallow flameproof casserole dish over a medium-high heat. Add the courgettes and fry them for 2–3 minutes until a light golden brown. Lift out onto a plate.
Add the remaining tablespoon of oil and the onion to the pan and fry gently for 5 minutes. Add the red and green pepper and continue frying until the onion is soft and lightly golden. Stir in the garlic and pimentón and fry for 1 minute more.
Add the tomatoes and fry for 2–3 minutes until softened, then stir in the rest of the stock, the saffron mixture and some seasoning to taste and bring to the boil.
Sprinkle in the rice and the parsley, stir lightly to evenly distribute the rice around the pan, then scatter over the cooked beans, asparagus, courgettes, peas and artichokes and shake the pan gently so that they all bed down slightly into the rice.
Lower the heat and leave to simmer vigorously for 6 minutes, then lower the heat again and leave to simmer gently for a further 14 minutes, until all the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is tender, but still with a little bit of a bite to it.
Remove the pan from the heat, cover with a large lid or clean tea towel and leave to rest for 5 minutes before serving.

150g cashews
3 tablespoons good quality cocoa powder
150ml warm water
1 tablespoon pectin
300ml coconut cream
150g golden caster sugar
200g vegan dark chocolate, broken into 2cm squares
2 tablespoons cornflour
","
Method

Empty the cashews, cocoa powder, warm water and pectin into a blender and blend on high until all is silky smooth. Pour into a large bowl and set aside.
Spoon the coconut cream into a medium saucepan and add the caster sugar and cubed dark chocolate. Heat very gently, regularly stirring until the sugar has dissolved and the chocolate has melted into the cream.
Measure the cornflour into a small bowl and add 2 tablespoons of the coconut chocolate mixture into the cornflour. Stir to combine until you have a thick, uniform, soft paste. Return this paste to the saucepan and continue to stir until dissolved. Continue to cook the ice cream base for 5-7 minutes, over a gentle heat until steam rises from the mixture and the cornflour has performed its task and thickened the mixture. The consistency will be that of double cream.
Pour the warm coconut and chocolate base into the cashew mixture and stir until thoroughly well combined. Cover with cling film and set the ice cream base aside to cool.
Transfer to an ice cream machine and churn until frozen, about 45 minutes. Transfer to a freezeable container and freeze overnight. Remove from the freezer a 5-10 minutes before scooping.

Add the lentils, 200ml vegetable stock, chestnuts, rosemary and remaining pumpkin. Bring to the boil then take off the heat. Season to taste
Spread the lentil mixture into 2 small oven proof dishes. Spoon the puree into the centre of each. Use a spatula to gently smooth towards the edges a little. Don’t worry if the puree sinks into the lentils a little
Lay two sheets of filo pastry on your work surface. Sprinkle them with smoked paprika. Brush all over with olive oil
Scrunch the pastry up into the size of the dishes. Try and keep as much of the pastry as possible off the chickpea puree’s surface because the moisture will make it go soft
Brush and sprinkle two more sheets of pastry. Put a second sheet of filo on top of each pie to make doubly sure that it’s crisp. Bake for 12-15 minutes until hot and golden. Serve!

Cut the lettuce into fine ribbons and place in a bowl.
Remove the chipotle chilli from the water and remove the seeds and membrane (if you don’t do this your mouth will be on fire!). Finely chop the rest.
Heat the olive oil in a frying pan while you chop the onion, garlic and tomato. Add these and the chipotle to the pan and cook until the onions become translucent – about 5 minutes. Add the cumin and paprika, give it a stir and then add the pinto beans. While this is cooking you can make the socca tacos.
Place a good, non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, adding a little oil if needed (see note). Once the pan is hot, spoon in some of the socca batter. I find a large serving spoon is about the right amount – making about 6 tortillas.
Wait for bubbles to appear in the batter. Once they have all popped, flip the tortilla over and allow the other side to cook – about 2 minutes on each side.
Pop them on a plate ready to serve.
The hot filling will also be ready by now, transfer this to a serving bowl.

I like to serve these by setting out all the dishes on the table for a DIY dinner – it’s much more fun!
NOTES: I recently acquired a ceramic frying pan which is perfect for this recipe. You can make pancakes – and everything else – without the need for a single drop of oil! If your pan is not super non-stick, use a little oil for the socca, as you would for regular pancakes. If you don’t want to be cooking the hot filling and the socca tortillas at the same time, make the tortillas first and set aside on a plate – they don’t need to be hot to serve. I’ve suggested using organic limes because not only do they taste great, but they are unwaxed (which is particularly important if you’re using the zest).

4 tbsp olive oil
170g red lentils
1 pint vegetable stock
1 tbsp olive oil
1 onion
1 clove of garlic
½ inch piece of ginger
1 bay leaf
½ stick of cinnamon
½ tsp cumin
½ tsp turmeric
½ tsp sea salt flakes
The juice of ½ a lemon

Method
Trim the ends from the aubergine and cut into ½ inch chunks.  Place the oil, sea salt and caraway seeds into a bowl and mix together, add the aubergine and toss into the oil until well coated.  Leave to marinate.
Roughly chop the onion and finely grate the garlic and ginger.  Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onion, garlic and ginger and fry gently until the onion has begun to soften – about 20 minutes.  Add the spices to the pan and continue to fry for a further 3 minutes.  Add the lentils to the pan and stir together until coated.  Pour over the stock, cover and bring to the boil, then leave to simmer gently for 20 minutes (try not to stir) or until nearly all of the liquid has been absorbed.
While the lentils are cooking preheat the oven to 180c.  Tip the aubergine onto a baking tray and roast for 30-35 minutes until golden.
Take the lentils off the heat and then using a wooden spoon, beat vigorously until you have a smooth and creamy dhal.  Stir in the sea salt and lemon juice, then spoon into a serving dish.  Roughly chop the coriander, and scatter over the dhal along with the roasted aubergine before serving.

Ingredients

Vegan feta cheese ingredients:
75g unsalted cashew nuts
150ml water
1/2 cup corn starch
3 1/2 tbsp nutritional yeast
2 tbsp lemon juice
1 tsp olive oil
1 tsp salt
1/4 tsp garlic powder
Other ingredients:
Watermelon slices
Capers
Thinly sliced red onion
Mint or rocket leaves
Olive oil

","
Method
Add all vegan feta cheese ingredients into a blender (no need to soak the cashews) and blend until you get a smooth cheese sauce.
Then pour it into a pan and heat up to high to medium heat. Stir continuously so it doesn’t burn. Slowly the sauce will turn into a thick paste. Once it has reached a paste-like consistency keep cooking for another 2-3 minutes as the starch needs to be fully cooked. If you don’t cook it long enough you might taste the starch.
Transfer the paste into a tupperware dish and even it out with a spoon. Keep it in the fridge for at least 2-3 hours (or in the freezer for 1.5+ hours) until it has set completely.
Then cut off slices and sauté the cooled down slices (don’t take it out fo the fridge hours before, it works best when they are cool) in a griddle pan on both sides until it turns crispy and you can see the burn marks.
Serve on a plate on top of a melon and add some capers as well. Garnish with either mint or rocket leaves. Drizzle some olive oil over it for some extra deliciousness (not necessary if you are looking to reduce calories). Enjoy!

Mushroom and Chestnut Wellington:

200g Chestnut mushrooms
100g Shiitake mushrooms
300g Chestnuts, roasted and peeled
125g Cooked black-eyed beans
1 Red onion
2 Cloves garlic
1 tsp Dried sage
1 tbsp Mushroom ketchup (optional)
1 tbsp Olive oil
Salt and Pepper

Shortcrust Spelt Pastry:

175g Spelt flour
75g Vegan margarine
3-4 tbsp water
2 tbsp non-dairy milk for brushing

","
Method

Begin by cooking your chestnuts. Whilst your chestnuts are roasting, finely chop the onion and gently fry in a frying pan until translucent and just starting to caramelise.


Mince the garlic and slice the mushrooms and stir into the onion. Sweat on a medium heat until most of the water has been released from the mushrooms and they are just starting to brown. Then set the pan aside to cool.


In a food processor, blend the beans and chestnuts until they start to resemble breadcrumbs. If you like a little extra texture blend the chestnuts separately and leave them a little coarser.


Place the bean and chestnut mixer into a large mixing bowl.


Blend the mushrooms in the food processor and add to the mixing bowl along with the sage, and mushroom ketchup if using.


Mix together well and season to taste and set aside whilst you make the pastry.


Measure out the flour and marg into a large mixing bowl and chop into the marg with a knife until cut into fairly small chunks. Then rub the mixture together with your fingertips until it resembles fine breadcrumbs.


Add the water a bit at a time until the mixture comes together in your hands to form a ball.


Place the pastry covered in the fridge for 20 mins before rolling it out on a lightly floured surface into a large rectangle.


Mould the mushroom mixture into a loaf shape in the centre of your pastry length ways.


Brush the pastry edges with milk and carefully roll the whole thing, leaving the seam underneath.


Pinch the ends together and brush the whole thing with milk, make a few small cuts in the pastry for steam to escape then place onto a greased baking tray.


Bake in a pre-heated oven at 180C for 35-40 mins until golden brown.

Mix the sugar and agave nectar in the cup of water and stir until dissolved. Add this mixture to a blender (high speed if you have one) with the frozen raspberries. Blend until thoroughly combined.
Strain the mixture through a mesh sieve into a large bowl or another vessel that will be easy to pour. This will remove any crunchy raspberry seeds that may not have been blended. This is optional but recommended. It creates a much creamier, more pleasant texture.
After straining, return about one half of the mixture to the blender. Then add the yogurt and blend again until smooth. Pour back into the bowl with the rest of your raspberry puree, and add the Grand Marnier, too. Whisk until incorporated.
Follow the instructions on your ice cream maker for the rest. This batch went through mine for between 15-20 minutes.

Add the eggplant and water, and cook, covered, until the eggplant is slightly softened, about 10 minutes.
Add the canned tomatoes with their juice, potatoes, bell peppers, zucchini, bay leaves, thyme, oregano, parsley, and tarragon. Stir, then reduce heat to low and cook uncovered for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are soft. (If water/broth evaporates while the vegetables are still cooking, add a little extra.)
Stir in the salt and pepper, along with the chopped basil. Serve immediately with a hearty, rustic loaf of bread.

For Your Edification
Mirepoix is a mixture of chopped onions, carrots, and celery, and to reduce some prep time, you can often find pre-chopped mirepoix in such grocery stores as Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods (USA only).
For Your Modification
Add your favorite vegan Italian sausage, such as Field Roast or Tofurky, to the stew at the end. I think for maximum flavor and texture, you will want to slice the sausage(s) into discs, fry them in a little olive oil, then add them to the soup in the last 10 or 15 minutes of cooking.

104,https://veganuary.com/recipes/vegan-chilli/,Vegan Chilli,"
Ingredients

1 white onion
3 cloves of garlic
Salt
Paprika
A chilli pepper – your choice of hotness
Around half a pack of vegan soya mince (dried or frozen)
Two tins of beans – kidney, white, butter or pinto beans all work well
Tomato puree

","
Preparation
Serves 4 to 6 people

Method

Like any good dish, start by frying chopped onion and garlic in a large frying pan. Chuck in some salt, pepper and a hefty sprinkling of paprika; at least a tablespoon.
Add chopped chili pepper – your preference of chili. One whole chili should do the job; go for birds eye if you want a hot one, or one of the larger chili’s, which usually don’t pack quite as much heat. Also, including seeds make it hotter, so ditch them if you are a mega chili weed!
Add the mince once the onions, garlic and chili are soft
When the mince has browned add your beans. I can’t imagine a chilli without kidney beans, they are a must.
Next, add a tin of tomatoes. Also add some tomato puree – how much depends on how rich you want it. Leave it to simmer. The longer you simmer, the tastier it will be. At least half an hour should do the job.
Serve with rice, nachos, tacos or jacket potato. Delicious accompanied with guacamole and salsa!

Ingredients

1 can Organic Kidney Beans (aprox 240g)
1 can Organic Chickpeas (aprox 240g)
2 cans Organic Chopped Tomatoes (aprox 280g)
2 Large Potatoes, washed
150g Fresh Parsley
2 Ripe Avocadoes
500g Mushrooms
900g raw Spinach
2 cloves Garlic
4 Ripe Tomatoes
1 onion
150g Fresh Basil
Juice of half a Lemon
1/4 cup Olive Oil
1 Tbsp Sunflower Oil
2 springs Fresh Rosemary
1/2 Tbsp Cumin
Salt and Pepper
Loaf of fresh Sourdough Bread

","
Preparation
1) Turn your oven on to a low heat
2) Begin by chopping your Potatoes into large chunks, ready for boiling
3) Place a large saucepan of water on to boil
4) Dice your onion and garlic. Leave half the garlic for your mushrooms and the other half for the beans.
5) Slice Mushrooms in half.

Method
1) When water is boiling – place your Potatoes in. Leave for approximately 15 minutes or until soft.
2) Meanwhile, heat your Sunflower Oil in a large Wok or frying pan. Add onion and half the garlic. Saute until brown.
3) Add the canned tomatoes, kidney beans, chickpeas, cumin and about 1/2 cup diced basil. Leave to simmer on a low heat. This should gradually thicken, so by the time you are ready to serve – you have a thick spicy bean mixture! Add salt and pepper to taste. Ideally this should have about 40 minutes to an hour to simmer and let the flavors marinate.
4) When your potatoes are cooked – drain out all the water and mash roughly with a masher or fork. Leave them nice and chunky and the skin on! Add your parsley, olive oil, lemon juice, rosemary, salt and pepper and continue to stir and combine all together.
5) Make small potato cakes with your hands and set aside.
6) Add a little bit of oil into a frying pan and fry off your potato cakes for a few minutes on both sides.
7) Once all are browned on both sides – pop them into the oven to stay warm until serving time.
8) In the same frying pan – add your sunflower oil, chopped garlic and mushrooms. Saute these over a medium heat until your mushrooms are cooked and nice and garlic-y. Add the spinach, rosemary and a sprinkling of salt and pepper closer to serving time.
9) About ten minutes before serving: halve your whole tomatoes and place them under the grill for a few minutes with a sprinkling of salt and pepper and a little drizzle of olive oil.
10) Flan your avocado by halving, removing the stone, scooping out each half with a spoon to separate from the skin and then slicing into a nice flan. Set aside.
11) Slice your Sourdough nice and thickly – you can optionally toast this and add some vegan butter or olive oil!
ASSEMBLE!!
Begin with your slice of sourdough and around it – arrange the potato cakes, spicy beans, mushrooms and spinach mixture, tomato and avocado. Finish your dish with a lovely spring of fresh rosemary.
Enjoy!

109,https://veganuary.com/recipes/avocado-fresh-tomato-garlic-basil-sauce-pasta/,Fresh and zesty pasta sauce,"
Ingredients

450g/1lb pasta – spaghetti or linguini work well, but feel free to experiment with other types, eg fusilli, penne, wholemeal noodles 
2-3 tbsp olive oil (extra virgin if possible)
3 large cloves garlic
2 large, ripe avocados – the ready-to-eat variety are best
2 large ripe tasty tomatoes – eg ‘beefsteak’ variety
½ medium red chilli
15 fresh basil leaves, torn – a good handful
Zest and juice of a lime
Salt and lots of black pepper

","
Preparation
Serves 4
Options

For those who prefer large quantities of garlic to be cooked, sauté the garlic in some of the olive oil first. Then just mix it in with the chopped vegetables, herbs and pasta as below.
Replace avocados with strips of roasted red pepper – home-made or in a jar. You will need at least half a large jar. Roasted peppers are sold either in brine or in oil. If the former, drain well and do not add extra salt to the dish. If they are in oil, omit most of the oil in the recipe.

Greener Pasta!
Boil a kettle of hot water, pour it into your saucepan, add the pasta and a little salt. Bring to the boil, then switch off the heat and cover the pan with a well-fitting lid. The pasta will continue to cook in the hot water – in the usual cooking time but without using extra fuel. Stir occasionally to prevent clumping.

Method

Cook the pasta in a large pan of salted boiling water according to the packet instructions – or see our Top Tip above.
While the pasta is cooking prepare the rest of the dish.
If you are cooking the garlic, do so now. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a small frying pan and fry it gently for a minute or two, making sure it does not burn. Remove from heat – keeping any remaining oil – and set aside.
If using the garlic raw, crush and set aside.
Peel the avocados. Remove the stones and chop into chunks.
Chop the tomatoes into chunks.
De-seed the chilli and chop fine.
Drain the pasta and mix in the prepared vegetables.
Add the remaining olive oil, lime zest/juice and basil leaves. Season well.
Serve immediately.

Ingredients

Plant milk of your choice – just under a large glass full (I usually opt for rice or almond)
A handful of frozen berries (mixed bag or blueberries are my favourite)
1 x banana
2 x tablespoons of dairy free yoghurt (Alpro Vanilla is great)
1 x tablespoon of chia seeds

","
Preparation
Special thanks to Victoria Harley for the image: split-pin.co.uk

Frozen berries are my secret smoothie weapon! So much cheaper and longer-lasting than buying fresh (for smoothie making). Plus they make the smoothie lovely and chilled, so it’s a win/win all round. You’ll find bags of these at any supermarket, and can get a mixed berry bag or entire bags of blueberries, raspberries etc. I love blueberries though as they’re delicious and full of antioxidants, including vitamin K.


Method

Put everything into a blender
Blend
Pour
Drink

You can add your ingredients to the blender in any order, but I typically go milk first to stop anything sticking to the sides. Alter the ingredients levels to suit your taste and desired thickness – the more berries you add the thicker it gets!

1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
2 small beetroot, peeled, boiled and pureed
150g chocolate
1 tbsp golden syrup
1 tsp balsamic vinegar

for the frosting:

100g icing sugar
1 tbsp cocoa powder
1 tsp vanilla extract

for the topping:

100g raspberries
1 tbsp icing sugar

","
Method

Pre-heat the oven the 180 degrees celsius.
Sift the flour, baking powder and bicarb into a large bowl. Gently stir through the caster sugar.
Peel and boil the beetroot for around an hour and then puree in a blender. Whisk together with the golden syrup and balsamic.
Melt the chocolate in a double broiler and add to puree – stir until smooth.
Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and add the wet ingredients. Gently fold and transfer to a lined cake tin. Bake for 30-35 mins or until a skewer comes out clean.
Allow the cake to cool completely before frosting – to make the cake completely even and suitable for the raspberry topping, slice off the top with a serrated knife.
Mix the icing sugar, cocoa powder and vanilla extract together before adding some water a tablespoon at a time (approx. 50-75ml or until it reaches the desired consistency), and beat with a spatula until thick and smooth. Spread over the whole cake using a palette knife.
Muddle the raspberries, leaving a few whole before stirring through the icing sugar. Just before serving top the cake with the raspberry mixture and slice.

129,https://veganuary.com/recipes/minty-vietnamese-summer-rolls/,Minty Vietnamese Summer Rolls,"
Ingredients

Ingredients to make roughly 20 rolls:
20 rice paper sheets (you can find these in larger supermarkets or Asian stores)
1 avocado, chopped into thin slices
1 small bunch of mint, leaves separated from stalk
1 small carrot grated
1 small onion chopped finely
1/2 cucumber chopped into thin strips
100g of green leaves (I normally use spinach) hard stalks removed
Dipping Sauce:
Soy Sauce
Sesame seeds
A few drops of sesame seed oil
Optional finely chopped chilli or chilli flakes

","
Method

Arrange all the ingredients so that they are easy to access. The rice paper rolls are very delicate, and get sticky when drying. I have found that the quicker you make the rolls, and the less you handle them you lower the chances of them breaking up. Having said that, do not worry if the paper rips. Just try and minimize the damage, they become much more solid after 15minutes or so. And they taste so good no one will notice the small tears trust me!
Place one sheet of rice paper into a bowl of warm water. Leave for approximately 30seconds or until the sheet becomes malleable.
Take the rice paper out of the bowl and place on a clean plate. Add a small amount of each ingredient, making sure no hard bits are sticking out that could damage the paper.
Now it is time to roll. Fold in 2 opposing sides of the rice paper as tightly as possible. Then take the third side and fold over, making sure it is tight and roll it over the fourth side to completely seal the summer roll.
For the dipping sauce mix the ingredients in a small bowl.

130,https://veganuary.com/recipes/tofu-sushi-rolls/,Tofu Sushi Rolls,"
Ingredients
Sushi rice – 150g
Tofu – 300g
Peanut butter – 2 tbsp
Soy sauce – 2 tbsp
Mirin – 1.5 tbsp
Sesame oil – 1 tsp
Garlic clove – 1
Avocado – ½
Carrot – 1
Sesame seeds – 10g
Rice wine vinegar – 1.5 tbsp
White sugar – ½ tsp
Salt – ½ tsp
Nori sheets – 1 pack
","
Method
1. Rinse and drain the sushi rice in a sieve. Place the rice in a small saucepan with 220ml of water, bring up to a boil, lower the heat to a gentle simmer, cover and cook for 15 minutes until all the water has been absorbed.
2. Drain and wrap the tofu in kitchen paper then place between two plates with something heavy on top like a couple of tins. Leave to press for 20 minutes. This process allows the tofu to take on more flavour.
3. Preheat the oven to 190 degrees celsius.
4. Prepare the peanut sauce. Mix the peanut butter with 1 tbsp of soy sauce, 1.5 tbsp of mirin, 1 tsp of sesame oil and 1 tbsp of water. Peel and finely chop or grate the garlic, then add to the sauce. Your sauce should be the consistency of single cream. If necessary add a splash more of water to loosen.
5. Prepare the filling. Cut the avocado in half, remove the pit and scoop the flesh away from the skin, keeping the shape intact. Cut the avocado into strips lengthways. Peel and grate the carrot. Divide both into 4 equal portions. Cut the tofu into 8 slices and coat with 1 tsp of soy sauce. Place the coated tofu on a tray and bake in the oven for 8 minutes.
6. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over a high heat for 1 minute or until golden, then tip onto a small plate.
7. Cool the rice. When the rice is cooked, take it off the heat and mix in 1.5 tbsp of rice wine vinegar, ½ a tsp of salt, ½ a tsp of sugar and most of the toasted sesame seeds, saving a sprinkle for garnishing. Spread the rice onto a plate and leave to cool, then divide into 4 equal portions.
8. After 8 minutes, take the tofu out of the oven and coat with half of the peanut sauce. Bake for another 10 minutes then remove from the oven and slice each strip in half lengthways.
9. Start rolling! Place a small bowl of water nearby. Lay 2 layers of clingfilm larger than the nori sheet over your clean chopping board. Place the nori on top of the clingfilm in portrait orientation. Using your hands, take one portion of rice and spread it evenly onto the half of the nori sheet closest to you, leaving a 1cm gap at the edge of the sheet. Wet your fingertips to stop the rice sticking to your hands.
10. Place your strips of tofu with a portion of avocado and carrots horizontally in the centre of the rice. Drizzle a little of the peanut sauce over the filling, then start rolling the sushi by placing your thumbs underneath the clingfilm and lifting the edge that is closest to you up and over the filling in the centre. Curve the rest of your fingers over the clingfilm and gently press against the length of the roll, squeezing the rice and filling together inside. Continue to roll the sushi away from you until you’ve rolled past the furthest edge of the nori sheet. You may need to use a little water to seal the edge. Repeat until you get 4 sushi rolls.
11. Use a sharp knife to cut each roll in half, then each half into 3 equal pieces. Rinse under the tap between slices to help get a clean cut. Garnish the sushi rolls with a sprinkling of the reserved sesame seeds and serve with the remaining soy sauce for dipping.
Top Tip: if you have a bamboo sushi mat, use it instead of this clingfilm method.

131,https://veganuary.com/recipes/hot-sour-pad-thai-salad/,Hot & Sour Pad Thai Salad,"
Ingredients

30g desiccated coconut
25g pecans, chopped
1 block (around 200g) firm tofu
For the marinade:
60ml water
3 tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 tbsp tamari, good soy sauce or liquid aminos
Zest and juice of 1 lime (unwaxed), a little juice kept back for the raw salad
1 red chilli
½ tsp cayenne pepper
4 dates, pitted
Black pepper
For raw the salad:
1 red pepper
1 medium carrot
15g fresh coriander
4 spring onions
150g beansprouts
Squeeze of lime
10g black sesame seeds
For the cooked salad:
1 tsp solid coconut oil (sesame oil would also work well)
6 cloves garlic, minced
1 red onion
200g tenderstem broccoli

","
Preparation

At least an hour before you start cooking, prepare the marinade by combining all the ingredients in a food processor and blending until combined.
Cut the tofu into 1cm pieces, place in a container and cover with the marinade. Leave in the fridge until required.
Thinly slice and de-seed the pepper, slice the carrot into thin batons, chop the coriander (leaves and stems) and slice the spring onions. Put these in a large bowl with the beansprouts, black sesame seeds and the remaining squeeze of lime.
Thinly slice the onion and cut the broccoli lengthways to have even thinner stems.


Method

Heat a large frying pan on the hob to a medium temperature. Toast the pecans until they begin to turn brown, add in the desiccated coconut and continue to toast until this turns brown too. Remove immediately and put aside in a bowl.
Add the coconut oil to the pan and mince the garlic into it, then add the onion. Cook for a few minutes until they begin to soften and brown.
Add in the tofu, with the marinade, and give it all a good stir. After a couple of minutes, I like to spoon some of the marinade out into the bowl with the raw ingredients, so that they’re nicely coated in all of the lovely flavours.
Add the broccoli to the pan and cook until wilted, and most of the marinade has been soaked up.
Remove from the heat, stir into the large bowl with the salad, and serve with a sprinkling of the toasted pecans and coconut.

NOTES
If you are unable to find tenderstem broccoli, regular broccoli, green beans or pak choi will also work really well.

2 ripe plums or peaches
1 red onion
1 bunch fresh basil
1 orange or yellow pepper
1 lime
250g green beans
50g black olives
750g small-variety white or gold potatoes
2 tsp sumac
2 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp peanut butter
1 pack firm tofu
4 cloves garlic
minced
1 fresh chilli
sliced
1 tsp oil (coconut oil works well)
1 tsp sweet paprika
1 tsp turmeric
1 tbsp red wine vinegar

","
Method

Heat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
Drain the tofu, wrap it in kitchen paper to soak up any residual water and slice it into small chunks (no smaller than 1cm).
In a baking dish, mix the minced garlic, chopped chilli, turmeric, paprika, soy sauce, red wine vinegar and a squeeze of the lime juice. Cover and set aside. Add the tofu and mix, carefully, until all the pieces are covered with the marinade.
Line a baking tray with a sheet of parchment paper or foil and slice each potato in half. Arrange the potatoes on the tray, skin-side down. Squeeze over some of the lime juice (this helps the dry seasoning to stick) and then sprinkle on 1tsp each of the sumac and oregano.
Line a second tray with parchment paper or foil and slice two of the tomatoes into eight segments each. Slice one of the plums or peaches into eight segments. Arrange these, skin-side down, on the tray.
Place both trays in the oven, the potatoes on a higher shelf, and cook for 20-25 minutes.
While the potatoes are cooking, cut the remaining tomatoes and plum/peach into bite-size pieces, thinly slice the onion and pepper, and chop up the olives and basil. I like to include the basil stalks too, they’re full of flavour. Combine all of these in a salad bowl with a squeeze of lime and some black pepper.
Cut the green beans into 1 inch pieces and steam or boil for about 5 minutes. Rinse under cold water, drain, and add them to the salad bowl.
Remove the potatoes from the oven and turn each one over. Squeeze over the rest of the lime and a further 1tsp each of the sumac, chilli flakes and oregano. Return to the oven for 20 minutes.
Add the oil to the tofu and put this in the oven, too. Cook for 15 minutes, give it all a stir and return to the oven for a further 10 minutes. It will be ready when all of the marinade has cooked off and the tofu is slightly crispy.
Remove all of the oven-cooked components and leave to cool for 5 minutes.
To assemble, carefully combine all of the ingredients and then pile them into individual serving dishes, topping with a nice spoonful of peanut butter!

143,https://veganuary.com/recipes/peking-jackfruit-pancakes/,Peking Jackfruit Pancakes,"
Ingredients
1 x 400 g tin young green jackfruit, prepared
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2.5 cm ginger, finely chopped
2 tablespoons rice wine, dry white wine or apple juice
½ teaspoon five spice powder
Pinch of black pepper
1 tablespoon dark soy sauce
Thin strips of carrot, cucumber and spring onion (scallion), to serve
½ cup (100 g) hoisin sauce
For the Pancake Dough:
1½ cups (225 g) plain flour, sifted
Pinch of salt
⅔ cup (170 ml) boiling water
1 tablespoon oil, for brushing
","
Method

First make the pancake dough. In a large bowl, knead the flour, salt and water until you have a smooth, elastic dough, about 5 minutes, adding a teaspoon more flour if it seems too sticky. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and leave to rest for about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200°C. Place the shredded jackfruit in a loaf tin. Whisk together the sesame oil, ginger, wine, five spice, black pepper and soy sauce and pour over the jackfruit. Roast for 15–20 minutes or until very tender – there may still be liquid in the tin, and that’s okay.
Unwrap the dough, roll it into a log and divide into 12.
Roll each piece of dough into a ball, then flatten slightly by patting it with the palm of your hand. Brush a thin layer of oil over six of the flattened dough balls, then place the unoiled dough balls on top of them to form sandwiches. Use a rolling pin to roll out each sandwich into a flat pancake, flipping it midway so both sides are rolled evenly.
Set a dry non-stick frying pan over medium heat, place a pancake in it and cook until it is puffy and the bottom is flecked with brown, about 2–3 minutes. Flip it over and cook the other side for 2–3 minutes, then remove. Carefully separate the two layers to give you two pancakes. Keep on a plate, covered with a clean tea towel, while you cook the rest, separating them as well, to give you twelve in total.
Transfer the jackfruit to a serving platter. To eat, scoop a little bit of jackfruit onto a pancake, top with a drizzle of hoisin sauce and a few slivers of carrot, cucumber and spring onion, then wrap up and enjoy.

Preparing jackfruit

After draining your tin of young green jackfruit, rinse it well in a sieve under cold running water – this helps to get rid of the slightly sweet jackfruit flavour. After rinsing, cut away the tough core of each piece of jackfruit, then shred the remaining flesh into something resembling pulled pork. Discard all the seeds and seed pods.

Ingredients

1 large red onion 
2 tbsp olive oil
2 cloves of garlic
2 medium courgettes
2 medium carrots 
1 x 400g tin of kidney beans 
100g cooked rice
1 tbsp harissa paste
2 tbsp crunchy peanut butter, or use sunflower seed butter if making nut free
A small bunch of coriander
50g sesame seeds
For the avocado salsa:
½ yellow pepper
2 tomatoes
1 large ripe avocado
2 tomatoes
½ a small red onion
1 red chilli
Juice of 2 limes
A small bunch of coriander

","
Preparation
I like to use the outer leaves of an iceberg lettuce to wrap round the burgers, acting as a crisp bun.  That way you can add the salsa and perhaps a little hummus to make a real feast of it. It’s really important that you grate the carrot and courgette by hand as using a food processor can make them very soggy.
Makes 10 burgers       

Method
Place the tomatoes in a bowl and pour over boiling water, leave for 1 minute, drain the water off and gently remove the skin by peeling it off with a small sharp knife. Cut the tomatoes in half and using a teaspoon, scoop out the seeds and discard. Set the remaining tomato flesh aside.
Finely dice the onion, deseed the chilli and chop very finely.  Slice the avocado in half, remove the stone and then using a spoon scoop out the flesh in one half and then finely chop.  Slice the tomato flesh and yellow pepper into very small juice and then combine all of the ingredients into a bowl.  Pour over the lime juice, finely chop the coriander and stir through.  Season to taste, cover and leave to stand in the fridge until ready to use.
Finely chop the onion and crush the garlic.  Trim the ends from the courgette and carrots and then coarsely grate using a hand held grater.  Finely chop the coriander and set aside.  Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large frying pan and add the onion, fry gently for around 5 minutes or until softened and slightly coloured at the edges.  Add the garlic, courgettes and carrots to the pan, turn up the heat to medium – high and fry for a further 5 minutes, stirring regularly, until the carrots and courgettes have softened and cooked through.
Add the peanut butter and harissa to the pan, season well and continue to cook for 3 minutes, stirring regularly, until blended with the vegetables.  Take off the heat and leave to stand for five minutes or until cool enough to handle.  Meanwhile, drain and rinse the kidney beans and place them in a food processor.  Blitz until you have a smooth paste and then transfer to a large mixing bowl.  Alternatively, you can place the kidney beans into the mixing bowl and mash by hand, using a fork, until you have a thick paste.
Add the cooked rice, coriander and vegetable mixture to the beans and beat together until combined and pulled into a large ball.  Take a handful of the mixture – about 3 tablespoons worth – and shape into a patty approximately 2 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick.  Scatter the sesame seeds over a flat plate, season and mix together before lightly rolling the burgers in them so that they are evenly coated.  Cover the burgers in clingfilm and refrigerate for 1 hour before cooking.
When ready to cook, heat the remaining olive oil in a large frying pan and cook for about 10 minutes, turning over once or twice, until golden brown and cooked through.

Ingredients

30g Korean Mint Leaves
5 Tbsp Flour
1.5 Tbsp Korean Red Chilli Paste (Gochujang)
0.5 Tbsp Korean Fermented Bean Paste (Doenjang)
½ Cup of Water

Cooking oil for pancake

1 Tbsp Perilla seed oil
1 Tbsp Soybean Oil

","
Preparation

Wash the Korean mint leaves and remove any excess water.
Cut the mint leaves vertically into 0.3cm strips.
Parboil the tofu in boiling salt water, then rinse in cold water. Gently “mash” or crumble the tofu into small pieces with your hands. To remove excess water, wrap the mashed tofu into a layer of hemp cloth and wring it, squeezing out the water.
Next, prepare a batter using the flour, red chilli paste and bean paste, adding water until it achieves the desired consistency. The ingredients should be fully combined but still thick, not pourable.
Add the Korean mint leaves and tofu to the batter.
Shape the batter into 5cm pancakes (about 1cm thick) and fry in the oil until cooked. Flip them over to cook on both sides.

Ingredients

Oatmeal cookie base ingredients:
2 cups (180g) jumbo oats
1 cup (100g) walnuts (you can use 100g of oat flour/ground oats to keep these nut free)
1/2 cup (160g) maple syrup
1/4 cup (60g) coconut oil
1/4 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
Topping ingredients:
1/4 cup (60g) coconut sugar (for caramel)
3 tbsp (45ml) full-fat coconut milk (for caramel)
3 tbsp (42g) coconut oil (for caramel)
1/4 tsp vanilla extract (for caramel)
Pinch or two of Pink Himalayan Rock Salt (for caramel)
80 – 100g 85-90% dark chocolate or Dark chocolate chips (for topping)
1/4 cup (55g) raw cacao butter melted (for homemade topping)
1/4 cup (30g) raw cacao powder (for homemade topping)
1 tbsp (20g) maple syrup (for homemade topping)

","
Method

Line a 12 cup muffin tray with baking paper circles. Grease the sides with melted coconut oil. I actually use a 12 cup muffin tray that has loose bottoms!
Preheat oven to 160C (325F).
Process walnuts to a coarse meal.
Mix together all oatmeal cookie ingredients.
Divide mixture amongst prepared muffin tray cavities; approx. 1.5 tbsp.
Press down to evenly distribute in each and then make an indent in the middle of each allowing it to come up the sides a little.
Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove and gently press down the centres before they cool. Allow to cool in the tray for 15 minutes before removing and place on a wire rack.
Meanwhile mix together coconut sugar, vanilla, salt and coconut milk. Bring to the boil and stir continuously until the sugar has dissolved…about 2-3 minutes.
Add in the coconut oil, bring back the boil and once again stir continuously this time over a medium to high heat for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for one hour.
Place baked cookie cups onto a tray lined with baking paper.
Place 1-1.5 tsp of the caramel into the centre of each baked cup. Place them into the fridge for 30 minutes.
Melt the chocolate or to make your own homemade chocolate, mix the melted cacao butter with the cacao powder and maple syrup. Sweeten to your own taste.
Pour 1 generous tsp of the melted chocolate or homemade chocolate over the top of each cookie cup just covering the caramel. Place in the fridge to firm up for 30 minutes. Store in the fridge and remove 10-15 minutes before serving for a softer caramel.

148,https://veganuary.com/recipes/seitan-rissoles-seitanfrikadellen/,Seitan Rissoles / Seitanfrikadellen,"
Ingredients

In a big bowl mix well:
1 ¼ cup water
1/3 cup neutral oil (I use sunflower)
1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce (or Maggi Sauce if you have)
1 teaspoon garlic granules
2 teaspoons mild mustard
1 teaspoon yeast extract (I’d use less Marmite or Vegemite, less than ½ teaspoon)
2 teaspoons hot paprika
1/2 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon pepper
1-2 finely chopped onions
In a smaller bowl mix:
1 1/3 cups gluten flour
4 tablespoons bread crumbs

","
Preparation
Makes about nine rissoles.

Method
Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture and stir well with a spoon. Knead a little with your hand until everything is well mixed, but don’t knead too long, otherwise you’ll squish the onions out of the dough. Cover the bowl with a warm, moist towel and let it rest for about 30 minutes.
Heat more neutral oil in a non-stick frying pan to medium heat. Form 9-10 meatballs and place them in the pan. They should not be crowded, I fry them in two batches.
It’s important not to fry them like you’re frying meat: they need to fry slowly on low to medium temperature (I use grade 3 of 6) for about 30 minutes. Flip them repeatedly after about 8 minutes to let them brown evenly. They stay soft for a long time and don’t start to brown till the end. After about 30 minutes they should be done, you can take them out when they have the desired colour.
Like most seitan ‘meats’ they’re best after cooling completely. Fresh out of the pan the crust is a little hard, it will soften after cooling while the inside gets firmer. They’re perfect after a night in the fridge. You can reheat them in a pan or in hot gravy. I serve them the traditional way, with mashed potatoes, roasted onions in a puddle of frying oil and lots of mustard.
Guten Appetit!

Ingredients

Ready rolled or a block of puff pastry or homemade puff pastry if you are up to it!
One box of Granose (or other) dried sausage mix

","
Method

Roll out or take out the pastry and slice into sections. Cut into long strips of around 10cm in width.
Make up the sausage mix as per the packet and place spoonfuls on the mix in a line, just off centre, on each strip of pastry. Don’t over fill, as you’ll have trouble closing up the pastry.
Fold the pastry over the top of the sausage mix, pressing shut the two edges with a fork. You can prick the pastry in top for some decoration too if you fancy.
Cut into around 8cm individual bites. It doesn’t have to be precise but just make sure they aren’t too small as you’ll end up with sausage bullets!
Cook on a baking tray for around 25 mins, or until golden brown. Make sure you give each one a little room as they don’t cook through and rise properly if they are squashed together.
They are most delicious eaten warm.

Ingredients

250g mushrooms
½ sheet nori
1 small, white onion
2 – 4 cloves of garlic
Oil
Pinch of salt
100ml hot water
Soya cream or soya milk

","
Method

Cut the mushrooms down to bite-size but quite large chunks and then toss them in a little oil.
Bake for around 20 mins until they are cooked and importantly – chewy. They will reduce in size in the oven so don’t make them too small. You can use any type of mushroom.
Slice the nori into shreds and then soak in hot water for 5 minutes or so. If the sheet isn’t that salty, you can add your own.
Whilst the nori is soaking, cut up a small, white onion and soften in a pan with some more oil. Once softened, add a couple of garlic cloves before adding the nori and the water it soaked in.
Add the mushrooms to the pan and a splash of soya milk (or cream if you are using) and stir until all is combined and lovely looking. You might want to add a bit more water depending on how dry or not you want the dish.
Serve and enjoy!

½ a bag of macaroni or fusilli
¾ cup of cashews – soaked for at least 2 hours
1 x onion
3 x cloves of garlic
4/5 sundried tomatoes (a handful)
1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon of miso paste
1/2 tablespoons of tomato puree
½ – 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika
½ teaspoon of turmeric
1 teaspoon of liquid smoke (optional)
¾ tablespoons of nutritional yeast
2 cups of veggie stock (I use Bouillon)
Juice of half a lemon (optional)
Optional: 1 x roasted red pepper or 1 large carrot chopped small and fried with the onion and garlic

","
Preparation
Serves four or two big portions with leftovers for the next day!
Serving suggestions: wilted kale and toasted sunflower seeds, roasted Brussel sprouts, roasted cauliflower and broccoli, steamed broccoli

Method

Put the cashews in a bowl with some water and cover with water and leave to soak – allow for two hours unless you have a mega powerful blender!
If using the pepper and roasting your own then rub with a little oil and put on baking tray and into hot oven. Allow for 30 minutes to cook. If using peppers from a jar then you can add later.
If serving with roasted veg, prep and put in oven alongside the pepper. Crunchy veg will take longer than the pepper to roast so timing should be about spot on.
Add pasta to pot of boiling water and cook as per packet instructions. When al dente pour into colander and rinse with cold water. Set aside.
While the pasta is cooking, finely chop your onions and garlic and add to a big pan with oil. Cook until nicely softened but not brown. If using carrot, also chop finely and add alongside the onions and garlic. Cook until carrot is soft.
Scrape down the pan and add the onion and garlic mix to the blender, along with the rest of the ingredients (don’t add the yeast last or you will lose some of it when it whizzes around). If using the pepper, this is when you add it. (Remove as much of the skin as you can before doing so and exclude all pips and the stalk.)
You now need to blend until lovely and smooth. This will take at least three or four goes depending on your blender. Scrape down the sides in between blends to make sure everything is incorporated.
Pour the mixture back into the pot that you cooked the onions and garlic in and allow to thicken on a medium/low heat. Stir frequently.
When thickened you can choose to add the lemon juice. I find that it lifts it a little but taste before doing so. Just add a little squeeze first if you like and then taste again.
Now add the cold pasta into the sauce, mix thoroughly and heat through.
When nice and hot it’s time to serve… Spoon into large bowls with accompanying veg. Dig in!

Ingredients

2tbsp olive oil
125g strong white flour
1 tsp baking powder
1 pinch of sea salt
275ml soy milk
2 packs Beyond Sausage Brat Original
For the gravy:
1 tbsp olive oil
1 red onion, thinly sliced
250ml vegetable stock
1 tbsp tomato ketchup
1 tsp dark soy sauce
1 tsp yeast extract
1.5 tsp cornflour
Fresh ground black pepper

","
Preparation

Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7. Pour the oil into a metal roasting tin, roughly 20cm / 8in – a cake tin will do as long as it doesn’t have a loose base. Put in the oven and heat for 5 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix the flour, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl. Add 200ml of the soy milk and whisk until smooth. Add the remaining milk and mix until thoroughly combined.
Carefully take the tin with the hot oil out of the oven; it will be extremely hot. Add the Beyond Sausage Brat Original to the tin, spaced apart from each other, then return to the oven for 2 minutes.
Take the tin carefully out of the oven once more and pour over the batter. Return the tin to the oven and cook for 30 minutes, or until the batter has risen, golden brown and hot throughout.
While the toad-in-the-hole is cooking, make the onion gravy. Heat the oil in a saucepan and fry the onion for 10 minutes, or until softened and lightly browned, stirring regularly.
Pour the stock into the pan, add the ketchup, soy sauce, and yeast extract. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Mix the cornflour with a tablespoon of cold water in a small bowl until smooth.
Stir the cornflour into the pan with the onion and return to a simmer. Cook for 1-2 minutes more until the sauce is thickened, stirring. Season with lots of ground black pepper.
Serve the freshly cooked toad-in-a-hole with the hot onion gravy.

166,https://veganuary.com/recipes/spicy-marinara-sauce/,Spicy Marinara Sauce,"
Ingredients

1 tsp olive oil
4 cloves garlic
1 red onion
1 heaped tsp smoked paprika
1 heaped tsp cumin
½ tsp cayenne pepper
2 tsp dried oregano
1 tin chopped tomatoes (400g) or 6 fresh, ripe tomatoes
1 tbsp pepper (or tomato) purée
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
Salt & pepper to taste

","
Preparation
Perfect for Spaghetti Marinara!

Method

Thinly slice the garlic and chop the onion.
Add the oil to a frying pan and heat to moderate temperature. Add the chopped onion and garlic and stir. Once softened, add the paprika, cumin, cayenne and oregano and leave for a minute to release the flavours.
Next, add the chopped tomatoes, purée and balsamic vinegar, stirring well.
Simmer for 10 minutes.
Pour the sauce into a food processor and blitz until smooth.
Pour back into the pan, add the salt and pepper, and leave to reduce further. Simmer for at least another 10 minutes.
If you’re not using the sauce straight away, leave to cool then transfer into a sterilised jar. It will keep in the fridge for a couple of weeks.

NOTES: If you are using fresh tomatoes rather than tinned, add an extra tbsp of pepper or tomato purée.

167,https://veganuary.com/recipes/speedy-sweet-potato-quesadillas/,Sweet Potato Quesadillas,"
Ingredients
Olive oil
1 sweet potato, peeled and grated
1 tablespoon maple syrup
Sea salt and freshly ground
Black pepper
1 teaspoon chipotle paste
1 red chilli, finely chopped
1 × 400g tin of white beans, drained
1 avocado
½ a lime
A few sprigs of fresh mint or coriander, leaves picked and chopped
4 corn tortillas
","
Preparation
Most places have started to stock chipotle paste these days, which has made its sweet smokiness easier to come by. If you can’t get your hands on chipotle, ½ a teaspoon of hot smoked paprika will do.

Method

Heat a touch of olive oil in a pan, add the sweet potato and the maple syrup and season with salt and pepper.
Add the chipotle paste and the chopped chilli and cook for a few minutes, until the potato has softened and lost its rawness.
Transfer to a bowl and add the beans, then use a potato masher to mash the whole lot up a little – you will still have some flecks of unmashed sweet potato. Season if needed.
Mash the avocado with a little lime juice and stir in the herbs. I use the potato masher again here.
Now heat a frying pan big enough for your tortillas. Lay a tortilla fat in the pan, spoon a quarter of the mixture on to one half of it, then fold over the other half.
Dry fry on one side until it’s blistered and golden brown, then flip over and do the same on the other side. Keep the quesadilla warm while you do this with the rest of the tortillas.
Serve straight from the pan with the mashed avocado.

As part of a bigger meal:
Serve with a couple of handfuls of lemon-dressed salad leaves.
Serve with a crunchy salad of radishes, leaves, shaved fennel and coriander, and a quick tomato salsa.

171,https://veganuary.com/recipes/curried-chickpea-burgers/,Curried Chickpea Burgers,"
Ingredients

175g cooked quinoa
1 x 400g tin of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 carrots
1 white onion
1 tbsp curry paste of your choice, just ensure it is gluten and dairy free
3 tbsp gram flour
3 tbsp olive oil

","
Preparation

Makes 8 burgers

They freeze well and you don’t need to worry about defrosting them, you can simply fry them gently from frozen until cooked through, making them handy little things. 

Method
Begin by peeling the onion and carrots and then finely grating, either by hand or using a food processor. Heat one tablespoon of the oil in a large frying pan and then gently fry the onion and carrots until softened – approximately 10 minutes.
Place the chickpeas and cooked quinoa into a large mixing bowl and crush together with a fork until you have a coarse, lightly-bound paste.  Add the softened onion, carrot and curry paste, season with a little sea salt and black pepper and mash together with a fork until bound together.
Using your hands, form the mixture into 8 burger patties and then coat each burger in gram flour, using as much or as little flour as you need to generously coat the burgers.
Heat the remaining oil in the large frying pan over a medium flame, add the burgers to the pan and fry the burgers on both sides until golden, slightly crisp and heated through.
While the cakes are frying dice the tomatoes, avocado and coriander.  Mix together in a small bowl with the lemon juice and season to taste.  Serve the burgers with a little pile of tomato salad on top and whatever accompaniments you like – roasted sweet potato wedges and a big green salad go very well.

172,https://veganuary.com/recipes/chinese-red-bbq-strips/,Chinese Red BBQ Strips,"
Ingredients

For the seitan strips:
– 125g (1 cup) wheat gluten
– 2tsp chinese five spice powder
– 1tsp smoked paprika
– 2tsp onion powder
– 2tsp garlic powder
– 180ml (3/4 cup) cold vegetable stock
– 3tbsp light soy sauce
– 3tbsp peanut butter
– 1tbsp sesame oil to grease the tin (or regular oil if you have no sesame)
For the sauce:
– 125ml (1/2 cup) hoisin sauce
– 125ml (1/2 cup) soy sauce
– 50g (1/4 cup) soft brown sugar
– 3 cloves of minced garlic
– 2tsp Chinese five spice powder
– tsp onion powder
– small amount of vegan red food colouring

","
Preparation
Start with preparing the seitan by heating the oven to 375f / 190c / Gas Mark 5.
You will also need:
– 8 inch x 8 inch greaseproof baking dish.

Method
Preparing the Seitan:
1) Combine the first 5 dry ingredients and set to one side.
2) To the cold vegetable stock, add the soy sauce and peanut butter. Whisk together well.
3) Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, add the liquid and bring together. You may need to use a spoon or spatula to combine initially but once it forms a dough the best thing to do is just get stuck in with your hands.
4) Kneed the dough in the bowl for 10 minutes or so until it toughens up and holds its shape. Let it rest for 10 minutes then kneed again for a further 5-10 minutes.
5) Oil an 8inch x 8inch dish, shape the seitan dough to the dish and bake in the oven for 30 – 40 minutes.
Preparing the Sauce:
1) Whilst the seitan is cooking in the oven, you can move on to preparing the sauce. Very simply add all of the ingredients to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat for 10 – 15 minutes until it has reduced, the sugar has melted and thickened the sauce.
Marinating and Cooking the Seitan:
This recipe works best if you can prepare it the day before and leave time for the seitan to marinate in the sauce overnight. However, if you’re pushed for time then marinating for 4 hours or so should suffice.
1) Once the seitan has cooled, slice into strips and add to a fresh dish large enough to accommodate the marinade.
2) To marinate, take half of the prepared sauce, add 50ml of water to thin it out and cover the seitan strips. Cover with cling film and pop it in the fridge.
3)  To cook the strips, once they have marinated for as long as you have time to allow, add them to a heated frying pan along with the marinade and fry on medium-high for 10 minutes.
4) Turn the strips over regularly to ensure even cooking and add the remaining half of the sauce. Lower to heat to medium and continue cooking for a further 5 – 10 minutes to heat through the sauce. Be sure to continue turning the strips every few minutes for even cooking.
The strips are now ready to use as you wish, whether it be with noodles, fried rice or in a veggie stir fry.

Preparation
This recipe serves 12. Delicious warm or cool.
Preheat oven to 180C and line a square baking tray with baking paper.

Method
To make the Salted Caramel:

Heat the coconut cream in a pan. In a separate pan, add the sugar and equal part of water (i.e. 4tbsp sugar to 4tbsp water).


Over low heat, swirl the sugar until it starts turning a golden colour.


Then add the cream.


Mix together the syrup, peanut butter and salt.


Whisk into the cream.


Mixture will turn a rich caramel colour.

To make the Brownies:

Make your flax eggs and set aside (For each egg, combine 1 tablespoon of ground flax seed with 3 tablespoons of water. Stir well).


Mix together all the dry ingredients.


I use a separate bowl mix together the wet ingredients.


Beat the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until a smooth consistency is reached.


Pour the Brownie mixture into the prepared tray.

175,https://veganuary.com/recipes/vegan-cream-broccoli-soup/,Cream of Broccoli Soup,"
Ingredients

1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil or 3 tablespoons vegetable broth or water
1 large onion, chopped
2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
32-ounce carton low-sodium vegetable broth or 4 cups water mixed with 2 to 3 teaspoons salt-free all-purpose seasoning blend
5 to 6 cups coarsely chopped broccoli florets and peeled stems
2 cups frozen green peas, thawed
One 15- to 16-ounce can great northern beans or cannellini, drained and rinsed, or one 12.3-ounce package firm silken tofu
1 cup unsweetened rice milk or other unsweetened nondairy milk, plus more as needed
To finish the soup:
2 cups finely chopped broccoli florets
1/2 cup chopped fresh dill or parsley, or a combination, plus more for garnish
Juice of 1/2 lemon, or 2 tablespoons bottled lemon juice, or to taste
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste

","
Preparation
Serves: 6

Method

Heat the oil, broth, or water in a soup pot and add the onion. Sauté over medium heat until translucent, then add the garlic if desired. Continue to sauté until the onion is golden.
Add the broth and broccoli. Bring to a simmer, then cover and simmer gently until the broccoli is tender but not overcooked, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the beans or tofu and half the green peas.
Continue to cook just until everything is nicely heated through.
The easiest way to puree this soup is to simply insert an immersion blender into the pot and puree until it’s as smooth as you’d like it to be. You can also leave it a bit chunky. If you don’t have an immersion blender, transfer the mixture to a regular blender and puree (don’t overprocess!), then transfer back to the soup pot. Add enough nondairy milk to give the soup a medium-thick consistency.
To finish the soup, add the remaining green peas, the finely chopped broccoli florets, the chopped herbs, and the lemon juice. Stir together, then season with salt and pepper. Cook over very low heat for 5 minutes longer, or until the finely chopped broccoli florets are tender-crisp, then serve.

·         Optional garnish: fresh oregano leaves

","
Preparation
Serves 2.
Heat the oven to 180°C / 350°F / Gas Mark 4.

Method

After rinsing, place the quinoa in a saucepan with 200ml water. Cover, bring to the boil and simmer until the water has evaporated (about 12-15 minutes). Leave covered for another 5 minutes.


While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the flax egg by combining the ground flax seeds and water in a small bowl and placing in the fridge.


Next, put all of the ground spices into a pan and heat, moderately, on the hob for a few minutes until you can smell the aromas. Give the spices a stir to ensure even toasting and remove from the heat.


The quinoa should now be ready. Fluff with a fork and place in a large bowl.


Place the chickpeas, half of the pumpkin seeds, half of the apricots, the maple syrup, flax egg and half of the toasted spices in a food processor. Pulse until well combined, into a paste. I like to have a few of the chickpeas left whole, but if you want a completely smooth texture, keep pulsing until this happens.


Turn out this mixture into the bowl with the quinoa and stir it all together.


Line a flat baking tray with foil and oil the surface with 1 tsp of the olive oil.


Make the meatballs by rolling a teaspoon amount of the mixture in your hands, placing each one on the tray. Make sure to wash your hands immediately after, to prevent orange staining!


Cook on a middle shelf for 20 minutes, turning half way through.


While the meatballs are cooking, make the sauce – Add the second tsp of olive oil to the pan that still has half of the toasted spices in it. Heat moderately, then add the chopped onion and garlic. Once softened, add the tinned tomatoes, stirring well. Add the soy sauce and vinegar and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour into the food processor (no need to rinse from making the meatballs) and blitz until smooth. Pour back into the pan to reduce further.


Add the remaining pumpkin seeds and apricots (chopped), the coriander and lemon juice. Keep on a low heat until you’re ready to serve.


If you’re serving the tagine with zoodles, make these now.


Assemble all the elements and sprinkle with more fresh herbs.

2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 cloves crushed garlic
3 large onions, thinly sliced, half moons
1 tsp ground cinnamon
2 large carrots, sliced in half
½ butternut squash, cut into bite size chunks
2 sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into bite size chunks

3 cups couscous
4 ½ cups filtered water
1 tsp sea salt
1 Tbsp olive oil (optional)
Canned organic chickpeas
Finely chopped spring onions
Fresh mint
Lemon infused olive oil
Sea salt

","
Method
Tagine:

Heat the olive oil in a heavy based pan.
Add the garlic, onion and cinnamon. Heat on low for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring to coat the onion and garlic with the cinnamon.
Cook until fragrant and crisp. Set aside.
In a tagine or heavy based pot, place the carrots, squash, sweet potatoes and courgette in sections.
Add about an inch of water, cover and place on a very low heat for approximately 25-30 minutes or until vegetables are soft.
Add a little more water if the tagine seems too dry. Serve on a bed of couscous and top with the onions and garlic.

Summer Couscous:

Add the salt and oil to boiling water.
Spread couscous evenly in the bottom of a large casserole so that it is in as thin a layer as possible.
Add the water and cover tightly with a lid or clingfilm.
Wait until all the water is absorbed (about 15 minutes), then fluff with a fork – add a little olive oil here if you wish.

For a delicious and simple couscous salad recipe, make the couscous as described above. Let it cool, and then toss it with canned organic chickpeas, finely chopped spring onions, fresh mint, lemon infused olive oil, and sea salt. Other nice additions are raisins, pine nuts, black and green olives, and flat leaf parsley.

Chickpeas, cannellini beans or borlotti beans add texture and extra protein for vegetarians.
Add lemon juice, loads of flat-leaf parsley, mint, coriander, olive oil and pepper for a salad.
Add roasted vegetables with cooked brown lentils for a great main course for a buffet or a packed lunch.

181,https://veganuary.com/recipes/refried-beans-with-corn-tortillas/,Refried Beans with Corn Tortillas,"
Ingredients

Sesame Oil 
2 cloves crushed garlic
1 onion finely sliced
½ cup coriander/cilantro finely chopped
1 jar organic mixed beans
1 to 2 tbsp tamari or shoyu sauce (to taste)
Mixed salad greens
Salsa or relish

","
Method
A few easy steps to refried beans:

Heat about 4 tbsp of sesame oil in a heavy frying pan or a wok, over medium heat.
Add the garlic and sliced onion and sauté until softened and beginning to brown, about five minutes, stirring occasionally.
Stir in the coriander.
Add the cooked beans, and using a big spoon, or potato masher start mashing the beans in the oil.
The unique taste of refried beans occurs as a result of slowly frying the starches inside the beans in the oil, so you want to add the beans a little bit at a time if you are using more than one jar. This way of cooking the beans makes sure they all get fried and take on the flavours of the vegetables and coriander.
Once all the beans have been mashed add the shoyu or tamari and a little water, until you get the texture that you want. Keep it a bit looser than you eventually want, as they will continue to firm up as they cool off the heat.
These will also freeze well, so it’s a good idea to make more than you need. The recipe above can be easily doubled or more.

Plate up:

Warm the corn tortillas in a dry frying pan for a few minutes either side.
Remove to a plate.
Spread with some vegan mayonnaise, fill with salad and top with the beans and some relish or salsa if desired.
If you prefer a hot spicy taste adjust the ingredients accordingly.

100g Ilchester Vegan Melting Mature
Salsa or dip of choice to serve
","
Method
1. Begin by preheating the oven to 180° and rolling out the puff pastry onto a
flat surface.
2. Using a brush, coat the puff pastry in the oil, and then sprinkle over the
smoked paprika so it covers as much of the pastry as possible.
3. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Next, finely grate the melting mature cheeze and sprinkle it over the entirety
of the pastry sheet.
5. Now, using a sheet of baking paper or clingfilm, place it on top of the pastry
and gently press down. This will push the melting mature cheeze into the pastry.
6. Carefully remove the paper and then using a sharp knife cut into 9-12 strips
horizontally.
7. Twist the strips and place them onto a baking tray ensuring there is space in
between them as they’ll puff up.
8. Sprinkle with any remaining grated cheeze and place the tray into the oven for
20-25 minutes. Serve with a salsa or dip of choice.

Ingredients

1 cup of dates
1 cup of walnuts
2 cups of grated raw carrot 
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp ginger
Dash of nutmeg
Dash of sea salt
3/4 cup raisins
For the frosting:
1 cup of cashews and 6 pitted dates soaked together in water for around and hour
Juice of 1 lemon
Dash of sea salt
Orange zest to decorate

","
Preparation
The key to this recipe is not to over blend as you need the mixture to stay firm and try to get as much of the excess moisture out from the carrots as possible.

Method
1) Put the walnuts into a food processor and pulse until they look crumbly, then add the dates and pulse again.
2) Add the grated carrot and spices and pulse until the mixture starts to look dough-like, add raisins and pulse for another thirty seconds – be careful not to over mix here, better less than more.
3) Push the carrot cake mixture down into ramekins – choose the size you like, or make a variety from small bites to large handfuls! Refrigerate for at least one hour.
4) Meanwhile, make the frosting. Drain the cashews and dates and put them in your food processor along with the lemon juice and salt.
5) You’ll probably need to add a little water to get the mixture moving. Blend until smooth and creamy(if your blender is high power) or smooth but textured (if it’s not).
6) Take your carrot cakes from the fridge and pop them out of their ramekins. Pipe over with the icing.

400g (14 oz.) spaghetti or linguine
400g (heaping 2 1/2 cup) cherry tomatoes
the zest of 2 large unwaxed lemons
100ml (about 6 Tbsp) olive oil
2 heaped teaspoons sea salt (if you are using fine-grain table salt, add a bit less)
1 × 400g (14 oz.) bag of kale or spinach
Vegan Parmesan cheese (optional)

","
Preparation
Serves 4 Generously.
The key to this recipe is to measure your water carefully and to use the right pan: you need a large shallow sauté pan or a casserole large enough to fit the pasta lying down.
A large deep frying pan or wok would work well too.

Method

Fill and boil a kettle and get all your ingredients and equipment together. You need a large shallow pan with a lid.


Put the pasta into the pan.


Quickly and roughly chop the tomatoes in half and throw them into the pan.


Grate in the zest of both lemons and add the oil and salt.


Add 1 litre of boiling water, put a lid on the pan and bring to the boil. As soon as it comes to the boil, remove the lid and simmer on a high heat for 6 minutes, using a pair of tongs to turn the pasta every 30 seconds or so as it cooks.


Meanwhile, remove any tough stalks from the kale or spinach and roughly tear the leaves.


Once the pasta has had 6 minutes, add the kale and continue to cook for a further 2 minutes.


Once almost all the water has evaporated, take the pan off the heat and tangle into four bowls.


If you like, top with a little vegan Parmesan.

½ tsp cayenne pepper, or more to taste
1 bay leaf
Sea salt or kosher salt and coarse ground black pepper to taste
4 green onions, chopped, white and green parts
½ cup chopped flat leaf parsley plus chopped leaves for garnish

","
Preparation
Gumbo filé, which is dried and ground sassafras leaves, is an ingredient sometimes added to gumbo but is not included in this recipe. It imparts an earthy flavor and is also used to thicken the gumbo. After consulting a chef colleague from New Orleans who specializes in Cajun cuisine, she informed me that the filé is purely an optional ingredient. In restaurants it is often contained in a shaker on the table which gives the diner the option to use it as desired.

Method
Prepare your mise en place (assemble and measure all ingredients).
Heat the oil in a large cooking pot over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper and celery and sauté until softened, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté an additional minute. Add the butter or margarine and stir until melted. Sprinkle in the flour, stir to combine and cook until the flour emits a nutty aroma, about 2 minutes.
Incorporate the water in increments while stirring vigorously. Stir in the tamari, Worcestershire, liquid smoke, tomatoes with liquid, okra, chickpeas, thyme, optional kelp powder, cayenne and bay leaf. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat; partially cover and simmer for a minimum of 1 hour. While the gumbo is cooking, prepare white or brown rice, your choice, and keep warm until ready to serve.
Five minutes before serving, stir the green onions and parsley into the gumbo (reserve a little for garnishing). Add salt, black pepper or additional cayenne, kelp powder and/or liquid smoke as desired to taste. To serve, place a scoop of white or brown rice into serving bowls and ladle in the gumbo. Garnish with green onions and parsley.

25g / 1 oz caster sugar (optional) 
125g / 4½ oz vegan margarine cut into cubes, plus extra for greasing

450g / 1lb organic cherries 
8-10 organic plums, depending on size 
6 medium organic apples (e.g. a mix of Bramley and Cox) 
1 tablespoon fairtrade brown sugar or agave nectar 
1 teaspoon vegan margarine 
Squeeze of lemon juice (optional) 
Pinch of cinnamon (optional) 
For the glaze: 
Apricot preserve, warmed and sieved

","
Preparation
To make the most of fruits in season check the helpful guides from Eat Seasonably and What’s in Season. Celebrate fruits at their very best, full of flavour and nutrients and produced in harmony with the environment.

Method

To achieve the best results when making pastry, everything needs to be as cool as possible, including your kitchen. You can even pre-chill your flour and the bowl you’ll be using!
Sieve the flour and sugar into the bowl and add the cubes of vegan margarine. Rub the fat into the flour using your fingertips, working quickly and with a light touch to avoid the fat melting, until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Check for any remaining lumps of margarine by shaking the bowl to bring them to the surface.
Make a well in the centre of the mixture and add the chilled water, a little at a time. Lightly work the mixture to form a ball, adding a sprinkle of flour if the mixture is too wet, or a touch more water if it’s too dry.
Allow the pastry to ‘rest’ in the fridge for 20-30 minutes prior to using it.
Roll out the pastry on a floured surface, then line a 9” greased flan tin and return to the fridge for a further 30 minutes to chill, as this should help prevent the pastry from shrinking.
Pre-heat the oven to 190ºC/375ºF/Gas Mark 5.
Bake the pastry case ‘blind’ (partially baking pastry before adding a wet filling, to avoid making it soggy). Prick over with a fork, line with greaseproof paper and fill with ceramic baking beans, dried pulses or uncooked rice.
Bake for about 15 minutes or until the pastry starts to become a light golden brown. Remove the paper and beans, then return to the oven for a couple of minutes. Remove the pastry case from the oven and allow to cool.
In the meantime make the fruit filling. Wash and prepare the fruit by either trimming the rhubarb, stoning the cherries or plums or coring the apples. Reserve the most attractive fruits for decorating the top.
Cut the remainder into small pieces and simmer in a pan over a gentle heat with the margarine, sugar or syrup, a splash of water and the optional lemon juice and cinnamon until soft and pulpy. In the unlikely event that the mixture is far too wet, simply remove any excess juice and thicken the fruit pulp with a little cornflour or tapioca flour. Remove from the heat and allow to cool, then use to cover the base of the pastry case.
Cut the reserved fruit accordingly – the rhubarb into pieces, the cherries and plums into halves and the apples into slices – and arrange neatly on top. If necessary, brush the apple slices with a little lemon juice to prevent them from browning. They look great laid in concentric circles, each slice overlapping the last! If you like, you can also brush the fruit with a little melted vegan margarine and sprinkle with cinnamon.
Bake for 25 minutes at 180ºC/350ºF/Gas Mark 4. If you want to brown the edges of the fruit, just flash the tart under a hot grill.
For a really quick and easy glaze, brush the tart over with the warmed, sieved apricot preserve.
Serve the tart warm or at room temperature. For an extra finishing touch, lightly dust with icing sugar and serve with plain soya yogurt which has been strained and flavoured with a little vanilla and cardamom.
Alternatively, you could indulge in some delicious Booja Booja ‘icecream’ which is based on cashew nuts and agave nectar. The ‘Keep Smiling Vanilla M’Gorilla’ would make a great accompaniment, or maybe the ‘Pompompous Maple Pecan’ or ‘Coconut Hullabaloo’!

198,https://veganuary.com/recipes/beer-battered-tofu-fish-chips/,Beer Battered Tofu Fish and Chips,"
Ingredients
180g plain (all-purpose) flour
1 tsp cornflour (cornstarch), plus extra to dust
1½ tsp onion powder
½ tsp garlic powder
1 tsp chilli powder
325ml pale ale (make sure you get a vegan one)
350g/1 block fresh firm tofu, drained and cut into 8–10 slices
1 sheet nori, cut into pieces to match the tofu slices
Salt and pepper
1 lemon, cut into wedges to serve
For the chips:
4–5 King Edward potatoes, peeled and cut into chunky chip shapes and left to dry out on a tea towel
750ml vegetable oil
For the mushy peas:
200g fresh or frozen peas
1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
A handful of fresh mint, finely chopped
For the Tartare Sauce:
½ jar vegan mayonnaise
2 tbsp capers, rinsed
1 gherkin, chopped
½ shallot, chopped
1 tbsp chopped fresh dill
A twist of lemon
","
Method

To make the chips, heat the oil to about 160˚C/320˚F. When a cube of bread browns in about 40 seconds, put half the chips in – you’re going to cook them in two batches – and fry for about 10 minutes until the insides are soft. Keep the temperature constant. Remove with a slotted spoon and leave to drain on a baking sheet covered with paper towels.
While the chips are draining, make the beer batter by combining the flour, cornflour, onion, garlic and chilli powders with the ale, mixing thoroughly. In a pan, heat the oil to 170˚C/340˚F. Check the temperature by putting a couple of drops of batter in the oil and seeing if it crisps up.
Dust the tofu and nori slices with a little cornflour, then coat with the batter mixture and add to the hot oil in batches. They should take about 3–4 minutes to get really crisp. Flip them over midway so that they get nice and golden on both sides. Remove with a slotted spoon, place on some kitchen paper to soak up any excess oil and season to taste.
When you’re ready to eat, heat the oil to 190˚C/375˚F, put the chips back in and cook until they’re golden and crispy. This should take about 6 minutes. Meanwhile, put the peas in boiling water with a little salt, bring to the boil, then cook for a couple of minutes until they’re slightly overdone. Strain, put them back in the pan, then crush with a potato masher, adding a little water if necessary to make them soft. Add the apple cider vinegar and chopped mint. Season with salt and pepper and slowly heat while mixing for a couple of minutes.
 Put everything together on a (big!) plate with a generous wedge of lemon and a dollop of Tartare Sauce* and enjoy.

* Tartare Sauce: Simply mix all the ingredients together and chill until ready to serve. The sauce can be stored in the fridge for up to 2 days.

Ingredients

For the tofu:
1 block (250-300g) firm tofu
2 tbsp gram flour + 3 tbsp water
2 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried onion granules
1 tsp smoked paprika
½ tsp cayenne pepper
For the BBQ sauce:
1 tin tomatoes (400g), puréed
2 tbsp tomato purée
2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
2 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp good soy sauce
Juice of ½ an orange
3 garlic cloves, minced
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1 tbsp dried oregano
1 tsp dried chilli flakes (or cayenne pepper)
Black pepper
For the ranch:
2 tbsp tahini
4 tbsp water
Handful of fresh dill leaves (about 10g)
1 garlic clove, minced
1 tsp lemon juice
½ tsp dijon mustard
½ tsp vinegar (apple cider, red wine)
1 tsp dried marjoram or oregano
Pinch cayenne pepper

","
Preparation
THE DAY BEFORE: cut the block of tofu into 5 slices, each about 1 cm thick, then cut each slice in half again so you have 10 pieces. Place between sheets of kitchen paper on a plate and freeze. Remove from the freezer a couple of hours before you want to start cooking, in order to defrost.

Method

Heat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
Once the tofu has defrosted, press between sheets of kitchen paper until most of the water has gone (you can do this using a heavy book). You don’t want the tofu to be so dry that it crumbles, but just to remove most of the water.
Combine the ingredients for the tofu coating ‘batter’ in a bowl.
Dip each tofu wing into the batter to fully coat and place on a non-stick baking tray, greased with a little oil if needed.
Place on the top shelf of the oven and cook for 30 minutes, turning once half way through.
Next, put the BBQ sauce on to simmer. Combine all the ingredients and cook on a medium heat on the hob, covering with a lid once it starts to bubble and spit. You want a thick sauce, so simmer for 20-30 minutes.
While the wings and BBQ sauce are cooking, make the ranch. Put all the ingredients into a food processor and blitz until smooth.
Once the wings have been cooking for 30 minutes, remove from the oven. Carefully place each one in the BBQ sauce, coat using a spoon, then place back onto the baking tray.
Cook for a further 10 minutes, arrange on a plate with the ranch and serve!

NOTES: Freezing the tofu isn’t essential, but it leads to a chewier texture. If you’re not freezing it, drain and press for a little longer, ensuring as much water is squeezed out as possible.

Ingredients

1 large squash, about 1.5kg (the more starchy varieties of summer squash are best, such as butternut) peeled and cut into rough chunks olive oil, for roasting 
a little sea salt
1 large fennel bulb, thinly sliced lengthways 
240g firm tofu, well drained
300g unbleached white flour, sifted 
1 teaspoon sea salt 
½ teaspoon white pepper 
1½ teaspoons dried sage 
2 big handfuls of sun-dried tomatoes, roughly chopped 
1x spinach pistou
For the topping:
2 tablespoons roasted hazelnuts, roughly chopped

","
Preparation
Serves 4 – 6.
First make the spinach pistou (even better if you can make it the day before). Pistou is a Provencal version of Pesto – much lighter, without the cheese and pine nuts.
Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6.

Method

Place the squash on an oiled baking tray. Rub a little oil and salt over it and bake for 30 minutes, turning the pieces gently over once. You’re not looking for loads of colour here, just lovely soft, golden squash.


Toss the fennel in olive oil, place on a separate baking tray and scatter with a pinch of sea salt. Bake for 30 minutes, turning once, until it’s nicely golden and sweet. When the squash is ready, put it into a processor with the tofu and blend until smooth. Now, place in a large bowl and stir in the flour, salt, pepper and sage until a soft dough forms. Leave to cool down and firm up – it will be a lot easier to handle.


Using two teaspoons, make gnocchi shapes (lovely little flat oval dumplings) with the mixture and place on an oiled baking sheet, leaving about 5cm of space for each gnocchi to grow. Brush the gnocchi with a little more oil and bake for 20–25 minutes, until crisp and slightly golden.


Serve the gnocchi warm, on nice big plates, drizzled liberally with the pistou. Scatter the crispy fennel and sun-dried tomatoes on top with a little more pistou, and finish with some chopped roasted hazelnuts.

207,https://veganuary.com/recipes/squash-gnocchi/,Squash Gnocchi,"
Ingredients

450g Squash (Harlequin, Crown Prince or any that you can find)
175g Brown Rice Flour
1 tbsp Flax Seeds
3 tbsp Water
1 tbsp Nutritional Yeast
10 Cherry Tomatoes
2 Large Handfuls of Spinach
1 Clove of Garlic
Olive Oil

","
Method

Begin by chopping the squash into smallish chunks and cutting or peeling off the skin.


Place the squash on a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and season. Roast for around 30mins at 180C until soft when you cut with a knife.


Set aside to cool slightly. Meanwhile make the flax egg by grinding the flax seeds in a spice grinder or food processor and whisk together in a cup with the water. Leave for around 5 minutes until it becomes gelatinous.


Put the squash into a large mixing bowl and mash until only a few lumps remain.


Add in the flax egg and combine, the slowly add in the flour and bring together.


Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and kneed gently adding a little more flour if necessary to form a smooth dough that isn’t too sticky.


Divide into 4 and roll each piece out with your hands to a form long, thin sausage.


Cut into 2cm pieces. Pinch the ends together with your fingers to create a slight crescent shape and imprint with the back of a fork.


Bring a large saucepan of water to boil, add in the gnocchi and simmer for 2-3 mins. When they rise to the top and float, they are done.


Whilst the gnocchi is cooking, wash and chop the spinach and tomatoes. Gently cook together in a frying pan with the garlic until the spinach wilts.


Spoon the gnocchi onto a warm serving dish using a slotted spoon and gently mix in the spinach and tomatoes.

Ingredients
FOR THE PIZZA:
300g light spelt flour
150ml tepid water
1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for cooking
8 tablespoons good tomato passata
A handful of small black olives, de-stoned
A small handful of rocket
FOR THE MUSHROOMS:
1 red onion
Olive oil
250g mushrooms
1 clove of garlic
A few sprigs of fresh thyme
FOR THE CASHEW RICOTTA:
200g cashews
The juice of ½ an unwaxed lemon
1 clove of garlic
A pinch of fennel seeds
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast (optional)
","
Preparation
Makes 2 Large Pizzas.

Method

First, get all your ingredients together and find yourself a large heavy based frying pan – you’ll need it to be around 26cm. Preheat your grill to maximum.


Slice the red onion and put it into the frying pan with a little oil. Tear the mushrooms into pieces and roughly chop the garlic, then add to the pan with the thyme leaves and cook for 4–5 minutes, turning every so often, until the mushrooms are charred and crispy and cooked through. Remove and put aside for later.


Next, make the cashew ricotta: put all the ingredients into the bowl of a food processor with 3 tablespoons of cold water and blend until completely smooth – this should take 2–5 minutes, depending on how powerful your machine is. It should be the consistency of normal ricotta. Scoop out into a bowl and wash the processor bowl.


Now make the dough. Put the four and water into the processor with a good pinch of salt and a tablespoon of olive oil and pulse until the dough comes together in a ball. Tip it out and bring it together in your hands.


Get your frying pan on a medium to high heat. If you have two pans about the right size you can do both the pizzas at once, otherwise you can do one after the other, as they cook quickly.


Cut the dough into two equal halves and cover one half for later.


Put the other half on to a floured work surface and use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 1cm thick circle about the size of your frying pan.


Drizzle a little oil into the hot pan, then carefully lift in the dough. Leave it on the heat for about 3 minutes, so the base is starting to cook, while you quickly top the pizza.


Spoon half the tomato passata over, then the mushrooms. Dot with the cashew cheese and the olives.


Pop the pizza under the grill for 4–5 minutes, until it is cooked through and the cashew cheese is browned.


Repeat with the second pizza.


To finish, strew with some rocket leaves and cut into generous slices.

2 cups vegan chocolate
200g granulated white sugar
2tbsp Vitalite (or any vegan margarine)
6tbsp of your preferred plant-based milk
1tsp vanilla paste

","
Method
1) Heat the sugar gently over a low heat and stir ever 10 – 15 seconds. As the sugar heats, it will clump up and go lumpy so don’t worry because you’re not doing anything wrong! Stick with it and it will gradually begin to melt.
2) The sugar should have all melted within 5 – 10 minutes and as soon as it has melted and turned golden in colour, remove from the heat.
3) Carefully add the margarine and stir well to combine. It will spit to be sure not to get caught by the melting margarine.
4) Once this has melted and been stirred in, do the same with the milk and sugar.
5) Remove to a heat-safe jar and pop into the refrigerator to cool (you can stick it in the freezer for the first 10 minutes or so if you are in a rush for it to cool).
6) Whilst the sauce is cooling, melt your chocolate and brush the insides of the moulds with the melted chocolate. Put them in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes to cool and firm.
7) Once your sauce is cooled and thickened ready for use, fill the moulds but be sure to leave a small gap at the top for you to encase the caramel with chocolate.
8) After filling the moulds with caramel, finish by covering with the remaining melted chocolate and be sure to fill in any gaps.
9) Cool in the fridge for 30 minutes – 1 hour and then they are ready to eat.

For the Crust:
200 g or 1 ¼ cups plain all purpose flour all purpose flour
70 g or 5 tbsp caster sugar
90 g or ½ cup vegan butter/margarine softened Or solid coconut oil
2.5 Tbsp milled linseed
5 Tbsp water
Finely grated rind of one orange
For the Filling:
200 g / ¾ cup golden syrup
3 tbsp / 40g brown sugar
150 g plain (dark) vegan chocolate
50 g / ¼ cup vegan butter / margarine
300 g pack silken tofu
1 tsp vanilla essence
175 g / 1 ½ pecan nuts

","
Preparation

To make the crust


To make the crust, sift the flour into a bowl, and stir in the sugar. Then work the vegan butter / margarine in with your fingertips.


Combine the milled linseed and the water. Let the linseed soak in the water for a few minutes. Then add the orange rind to the linseed.


Stir in the linseed and rind mix to the flour, butter / margarine and sugar to form a firm dough. If it is too sticky, add a touch more water.


Knead the dough, then roll it out. Line a tart or flan tin (one about 20 cm wide), ideally one with a loose base. Put the tin in the fridge to chill while making the filling.



Preheat the oven to 180⁰C / 350⁰C / Gas 4.





To make the filling:



To make the filling melt the syrup, sugar, chocolate and butter in a small pan. Keep stirring the mix and keep the heat low so it doesn’t burn. Once melted and mixed in, take off the heat.



Blend the silken tofu in a food processer / blender, and add to the syrup, sugar, chocolate and butter mix. Also add the vanilla essence.



Take the pastry case from the fridge. Sprinkle the pecan nuts into the pastry case. Then pour the chocolate mixture into the pastry case. Give the tin a little tap to remove any air bubbles and even out the mixture.



Put the pie tin on a baking sheet and bake for 50-60 minutes or until filling is set. Leave the pie in the tin for 10 minutes once baked, then remove from tin (if using a loose base tin).


Decorate with your choice of pecans, chocolate shavings, orange rind or edible flowers.

2 tbsp cider vinegar
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp toasted pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds
1 tsp Tahini
1/2 tsp chilli flakes
","
Method
1. Give the quinoa a good rinse through in a sieve and then add to a small saucepan and cover with 150 ml of cold water ( about twice its volume). Season with a little salt ( plus a pinch of smoked paprika if you have traditional quinoa) and boil for between 12 and 15 minutes until it has swelled and you can see a little “halo” around each grain.
2. Meanwhile you can drain the peas using the same sieve ( reserve the liquid if using chickpeas – this aquafaba is great for vegan mayo or baking).
3. Grate about 1/2 of the orange zest into the quinoa pan and then peel the orange and cut into slices or segments – the choice is yours. Reserve any juice.
4. Now prep’ your veg: Remove the outer leaves of the sprouts and slice fairly finely.
5. Slice the spring onions, using as much of the green as possible.
6. Crush the garlic and pick the parsley leaves from the stalks.
7. Once the quinoa is cooked, and has absorbed all the water, add the Carlin peas ( or chickpeas) and the vinegar, set aside with a lid on so that it steams.
8. Now take a frying pan, heat up 1/2 of the olive oil and add the sliced sprouts, 1/2 of the garlic and spring onion. Fry briefly, just until you can really smell the garlic.
9. Mix together the tahini with the remaining olive oiled garlic, the orange juice and season.
10. Now serve up the quinoa and peas, stirring in about 1/2 of your sprouts and then topping with the rest of them, the orange, the parsley, the pumpkin seeds and chilli flakes. Taste and balance the seasoning.
Serve hot or at room temperature. Perfect for a lunch box too.

4 tbsp olive oil
1 small white onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed
100g chestnut mushrooms, finely sliced
1 block of tempeh, 200g
3 tbsp of soy sauce
2 tbsp of nutritional yeast
Salt and pepper
1/2 cup of cooked brown rice
1/3 cup of oat flour

","
Preparation

Add 2 tbsp of the oil to a large frying pan, then add the chopped onion and garlic. Sauté on a medium heat for 5-8 minutes, until they start to caramelise.
Add the chopped mushrooms and cook for another 10 minutes, until they have shrunk in size and all the water has evaporated.
Crumble the Tiba Tempeh block, either using a knife or a food processor. You’re looking for a consistency that’s a bit like mince.
Add the tempeh “mince” to the pan along with the soy sauce and nutritional yeast or Marmite, if using. Cook for another 5 minutes, then season with salt and pepper.
Pour the mixture into a bowl and add the cooked brown rice and oat flour. Mix everything together until you have a fairly sticky mixture.
With wet hands, roll the mix into individual balls about the size of a golf ball. Repeat the process until you have used up all the mixture.
Heat up the remaining oil and fry the tempeh balls for a few minutes on each side, until slightly golden brown. You might need to cook them in batches.
Serve hot with your favourite tomato sauce and the pasta of your choice. Delicious.

"
233,https://veganuary.com/recipes/almond-milk/,Almond Milk,"
Ingredients
2 cups of almonds (either blanched or skinned is fine)
9 cups cold water
","
Preparation
Equipment

Bowl and water for soaking the almonds
Measuring cups
Food processor
Jam straining bag
Glass bottle with airtight lid


Method
Add the almonds to a bowl and fully cover with cold water. Soak overnight or for at least 8 hours; you may need to top the water up the next day if you’re not using them immediately, as they soak it up and expand.
* Time Saving Tip *
In a hurry? Pour boiling water over the almonds, soak for two hours and they will soften quick enough to use.
Drain and rinse until the water runs clear. The nuts will have expanded and you’ll now have almost 3 cups worth, so measure out 1 cup and add to the food processor.
Blitz for 20 seconds until they’re broken into tiny crumb-like pieces, then pour in 3 cups of chilled water and blitz again for another 30 seconds. Stretch the jam-straining bag over the edges of the bowl, and pour the mixture in.
After two minutes, gently squeeze the outside of the bag to get as much milk out of the pulp as possible. Set the pulp aside and repeat the steps twice more.
* Time Saving Tip *
If you’re making this regularly, using a jam bag stand makes the process easier, this is mine.
Once you’ve finished, rinse your straining bag and leave to dry naturally. Look after it this way and it can be reused over and over again.
* Top Tip *
You can use the leftover pulp as almond ‘flour’ for other recipes like our ginger nut crunch muesli. Simply spread out on a baking tray and ‘dry out’ for 1 hour in a 125c oven. Once cool, store in an airtight jar.
Pour the milk into glass containers that have airtight lids, I use Kilner bottles. Store in the fridge for up to 5 days; as the milk doesn’t contain emulsifiers, it will naturally separate in the bottle. Simply shake well each time before using and enjoy the goodness of your own homemade almond milk – it’s perfect for breakfast, fresh fruit smoothies, ice lollies, or as an everyday delicious milk substitute!

Dry ingredients:
150g wholemeal flour
2 tsp dried rosemary
¼ tsp cayenne pepper
Black pepper
Wet ingredients:
4 tbsp water
1 tbsp olive oil
2 tsp tapenade
4 sun dried tomatoes (about 15g), rehydrated & chopped small
Optional flavourings:
Nutritional yeast
lemon zest

","
Method

Heat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
Sift the flour into a mixing bowl and mix in the remaining dry ingredients.
Stir in the wet ingredients, then combine into a dough using your hands. It should come together to form a smooth ball, but if it feels a little dry, add more water a few drops at a time.
Roll flat between two sheets of parchment paper (this saves using extra flour – the dough is quite sticky), to about 2mm.
Cut the cookies into shapes or straws as desired.
Place on a parchment-lined baking tray and cook on the middle shelf for 15-20 minutes, or until crisp.

NOTES: The dough can be made in advance and kept wrapped in cling film in the fridge. If using sun dried tomatoes kept in oil, mop up the excess with kitchen paper and adjust the amount of oil in the recipe as necessary.

Ingredients

For the rice:
300g / 10½ oz sushi rice or short grain pudding rice
450ml / 15.2 fl oz water
150ml / 5.1 fl oz canned coconut milk
2 tablespoons caster sugar
½ teaspoon salt
2 cardamom pods, lightly crushed
Few drops mirin (optional)
For the topping:
Strips of fruit approx. 6cm long, cut as thinly as possible (e.g. watermelon and mango or peach)
Sieved apricot jam

","
Method

Rinse the rice well using a sieve until the water runs clear. Drain thoroughly in a colander and allow to dry for 20 minutes.
In a medium saucepan, combine the rice with the cold water and bring to a boil over a high heat. Cover and cook over a moderate heat for 10 minutes.
Reduce to a low heat and cook for a further 10 minutes. The rice should be tender and the water absorbed.
Remove from the heat but keep covered and stand for 15 minutes.
(Alternatively, if you have a rice cooker, that can be used to cook the rice.)
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the coconut milk, sugar, salt, cardamom pods and optional mirin. Warm over a low heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.
Remove the cardamom pods and allow the coconut mixture to cool a little.
Add to the rice and gently stir through. Keep stirring until all the liquid is incorporated. Cover the rice with a clean damp tea towel.
Take spoonfuls of rice, one at a time, and shape into rectangles with rounded ends. Press firmly but gently without squashing the rice.
Brush the top of each piece of nigiri with jam and top with a fruit slice, applying just enough pressure to secure it in place.
Do not refrigerate the nigiri before serving. Consume the same day. Serve with small dipping bowls of raspberry coulis, if desired.

200g beluga lentils
2 carrots
2 courgettes
For the dressing:
60g sundried tomatoes in oil
20g ginger, freshly ground
6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
6 tbsp white balsamic vinegar
2 tbsp Tikkacurry paste (see TIP)
1 tbsp chilli oil
Freshly ground fine sea salt and white pepper

Preparation
tibits at home: stylish vegetarian cuisine is a sumptuous cookbook, split into four seasonal sections, containing 50 recipes that will delight all loyal tibits fans, as well as those who are new to the brand. 80 per cent of tibits’ menu is vegan and many of the recipes in the book are also vegan – good news for the rapidly increasing number of vegans in the UK.

Method

Cook the lentils in salted water, for about 18 minutes.
Wash and peel the carrots and chop into 1 cm dice. Add to the lentils and cook for another 2 minutes, then drain immediately. Rinse under running cold water and drain well.
Wash the courgettes, chop into 1 cm dice and add to the lentils.
Finely chop the sundried tomatoes. Mix all remaining dressing ingredients and add the chopped tomatoes.
Mix the lentils with the dressing and season to taste, with salt and pepper.

Tips: these small, black lentils glisten when they cook, which makes them look like Beluga caviar. Since they do not disintegrate when cooked, they work equally well in appetisers, side dishes or as garnish. Tikka curry paste is a popular ingredient in Northern Indian cuisine and mainly used for sauces and marinades. Add some olive oil if desired.

Ingredients

1 x large potato
1 x large carrot
(3 tablespoons of the potato/carrot water)
1/2 cup of oil (I use olive)
1/2 cup of nutritional yeast
Juice of half a lemon
Teaspoon of garlic granules
Dash of celery salt
Cracked pepper

","
Preparation
This is the same cheese recipe featured in my Cheese on Toast, just in another guise. 

Method
There are lots of recipes for potato cheese out there, but this is the one I have adapted from various different ones*.

Peel one large potato and one large carrot
Chop into small chunks (carrot smaller than the potato as it is harder)
Boil until soft
Put 3 tablespoons of the potato water into a food processor
Drain potatoes and carrots and pour into the processor
Add: 1/2 cup of oil (I use olive), 1/2 cup of nutritional yeast, juice of half a lemon, teaspoon of garlic granules, dash of celery salt, cracked pepper
Blend!
You can eat this cheese straight away with tortilla chips, pour over nachos (maybe chuck it in the oven for a bit to make sure the cheese is really warm) or use as your cheese topping on pizza… Spread as liberally as you like! Sometimes you feel like more or less cheese, depending on your mood and/or the pizza toppings. The photos above are both with the same cheese… Just lots more on one that the other.
When cooked to your liking, remove and eat!

*According to everything I’ve read, this cheese can last up to 7 days in the fridge. Mine has never hung around that long, so I would say use within a couple of days to be on the safe side.

If there are still some lumps put back in the microwave for 10 to 15 seconds and mix again. There should always be some lumps when you remove from the microwave that you stir out.

Ingredients
140 g Self Raising Flour
30 g Cocoa Powder
1 tbs Cornflour
1/2 tsp Bicarbonate Soda
1/2 tsp Baking Powder
1/4 tsp Salt
125 g Caster Sugar
235 ml Soy milk
1 tsp Red Wine Vinegar
120 ml Sunflower Oil
1 tsp Vanilla Extract tsp
125 g Black cherry jam
230 g Black cherries Jar or canned

2 tsp Vanilla Extract tsp
2 Canned coconut milk (Chilled)
80 g Icing Sugar – for garnish
15 g Pistachios – for garnish
5 g Rose petals – for garnish
","
Method
1. For the swiss roll. Preheat your oven to 160ºC Fan/Gas 3. Line a shallow baking tray approximately 30cm x 20cm with greaseproof paper.
2. Sift the flour and cocoa powder into a large bowl, then add the cornflour, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, salt and sugar and stir together.
3. Pour the milk, vinegar, oil and vanilla extract into a jug and whisk until combined.
4. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir well with a light hand, be careful not to overwork the batter then pour into the prepared baking tray and bake in the oven for approximately 25 minutes until cooked through and a skewer comes out clean.
5. Meanwhile for the buttercream. Add the icing sugar and butter into a food processor and blitz together. Add the soya milk, a little at a time until the buttercream starts to combine and is smooth. You want a medium to firm texture.
6. Once the cake is cooked. Leave to cool for around 5 minutes and then carefully roll into a swiss roll shape, keeping the greaseproof paper on. When cooled after around half an hour, gently unroll the log and spread with black cherry jam and the buttercream. Once again carefully re-roll the cake this time gently removing the greaseproof paper as you roll. Once rolled place the log on a piece of clingfilm and roll tightly and place in the fridge to chill until needed, you could actually freeze the cake at this stage for half an hour.
7. To assemble. Slice the swiss roll into 8-10 slices and place inside a medium size glass bowl. Drain the cherries , reserving the juice, and add to the bowl then drizzle over some of the reserved juice.
8. For the custard. Add the soya milk and vanilla extract into a pan and gently warm. Remove from the heat and add 1-2 tablespoons of the warmed milk into a jug with the Birds custard powder and sugar. Stir until you have a smooth paste and then add the rest of the milk, whisk and then pour back into the pan. Heat gently until thickened and then remove from the heat. Leave to cool for 10 minutes then pour over the sponge mixture, place in the fridge and leave to set.
9. For the topping. Remove the lids off the canned coconut and scoop the solid coconut cream into a bowl (you do not want any of the coconut water) then add the icing sugar and whisk until smooth. Pile the cream topping onto the trifle, spread evenly to the outer edges..
10. Garnish with pistachios and rose petals
NOTES
1. You could use ready made custard but this will have a looser set.
2. An alternative garnish would be with leftover cherries and chocolate shavings.

Ingredients

For the coconut whip:
250ml coconut cream (make sure it’s cream and not creamed coconut)
1/2 tsp peppermint extract
3-5 drops green gel food colouring (or you can use a natural dye like spinach juice)
For the aquafaba meringue:
1 can of chickpeas, liquid drained off (about 1 cup of liquid)
1 cup icing sugar (powdered sugar)
1/2 tsp cream of tartar
To assemble:
200g dark chocolate chips

","
Preparation
I used chickpea brine that I had frozen and then defrosted in this recipe with great results. Remember to save your brine!

Method

First make the mint coconut whip. In a stand mixer add the coconut cream and peppermint extract. Beat on high for about 5 minutes using the balloon whisk attachment.


Once the coconut cream begins to whip add the food colouring. Whip again for another 3 minutes or until soft peaks appear. Scrape out into a container and set aside. Wipe out the mixer bowl.


Next prepare the meringue, pour the chickpea brine into the bowl of the mixer and beat on high with the balloon whisk for 5-8 minutes.


Once the soft peaks start to appear, add the cream of tartar. Keep whipping for another 5 minutes, adding the icing sugar in small amounts.


Once the meringue has formed stiff peaks, fold in the mint coconut whip using a spatula. Carefully fold in the chocolate chips.


Pour the ice cream into a container and immediately place in the freezer for minimum 8 hours, preferably overnight. Remove from the freezer 5 minutes before serving.

170g self-raising flour (gluten-free self-raising flour is okay too!)
30g cocoa powder
120g caster sugar or coconut sugar
1 tsp baking powder
200ml soya or nut milk
80ml sunflower oil
1 tsp vanilla extract
For the icing:
325g icing sugar
50g cocoa powder
60g vegetable fat (i.e. Trex or a Stork solid block Coconut Oil)
60g dairy-free margarine (Naturli Organic Vegan Spreadable is palm oil-free!)
20-30ml soya or nut milk
1 tsp vanilla extract
","
Method
For the cake:

Grease 2 round 8, 9 or 10″ cake tins and preheat oven to about 185 C.
Stir all the dry ingredients together (flour, cocoa powder, sugar and baking powder) and then add the wet ingredients in (plant milk, oil and vanilla) remembering to stir just until mixed. Spoon the cake mixture into a prepared tin. Repeat process for the second layer.
Tap each tray onto the work surface to stop the raising agents working too quickly – you will see the bubbles pop. Bake about 20 minutes.
Cool for about 10-15 minutes and then remove cakes from tins and cool completely on a wire rack. Put the layers into a plastic air tight container for at least 2 hours before decorating.

For the icing:

Using an electric mixer (or a hand-held mixer), whip together the vegetable fat, margarine and vanilla until creamy (about 1 minute). Add half of the icing sugar and all the cocoa powder.
Continue mixing (slowly at first and then bringing up to speed) mixing until combined. Add the rest of the icing sugar and slowly drip in the plant-based milk until it reaches your desired consistency.

You do not need to add all of the plant-based milk if you feel it is soft enough!
Decorating:
Spread some of the chocolate icing between the 2 cake sponges and sandwich together. Spread the remaining icing on the top and along the sides of the cake if you wish. Add vegan sweets, sprinkles and chocolates to your heart’s content!

258,https://veganuary.com/recipes/baked-tofu/,Baked Marinaded Tofu,"
Ingredients

1 block of firm or extra firm tofu, drained and sliced
3 tbl soy sauce
1 tbl mustard
1 tbl olive oil
3/4 cup of vegetable stock
2 tsb garlic powder

","
Preparation
Preheat the oven to 220 degrees and line a baking tray.
Press the tofu – put it on a flat surface with kitchen towel on top and underneath and then stack heavy books on top. The aim is to squeeze some of the moisture out, not squash it flat. Press it for at least 15 mins, longer if possible, this helps it crisp up when cooking.
Cut the pressed tofu into cubes – up to you how big but I would recommend about 2 x 2 cm cubes.

Method
In a large bowl mix together the soy sauce, mustard, olive oil, vegetable stock and garlic powder.
Add the tofu and ensure it’s well coated, marinate for at least one hour (the longer the better) and stir occasionally.
Place the marinated tofu in a single-layer on the baking sheet and place the tofu in the oven. After 15 minutes turn over and add some extra marinade. Cook for another 15 minutes.
Take out of the oven once nicely browned.
You can either eat it straightaway in a salad, stir-fry or pasta dish, or keep refrigerated and use within the next 5 days.

50g quinoa, rinsed and drained
3 tbsp tahini
2 tsp olive or coconut oil
2 tbsp maple syrup or other liquid sweetener
Pinch Himalayan pink salt (or other good salt)
20g pumpkin seeds
350g frozen pitted cherries, or 200g fresh
50g flaked almonds

","
Method
Heat the oven to 180°C / 350°F / Gas Mark 4.
After rinsing, place the quinoa in a saucepan with 100ml water. Cover, bring to the boil and simmer until the water has evaporated (about 10 minutes). Leave covered for another 5 minutes.
While the quinoa is cooking, simmer the cherries in a saucepan on a medium heat. Mash with the back of a wooden spoon or fork to transform them into a jam-like consistency. This will take around 10 minutes.
Once the quinoa is ready, add it to a mixing bowl with the tahini, oil, maple syrup, salt, pumpkin seeds and half of the flaked almonds. Give it all a good stir and pour it into your baking tin, pressing down with the back of a spoon.
Next, pour on the cherries and smooth out the surface. Sprinkle on the remaining flaked almonds, pressing down to give an even coverage.
Place on the top shelf of the oven and cook for 30 minutes.
NOTES: I find frozen cherries work really well in this recipe, as they cook down more easily. However, if you use fresh cherries, add a tbsp or two of water to the pan when simmering to help the cooking process.

Ingredients

2 baking potatoes
1 large apple
1 pear
Rock salt 
Cooking oil
A pinch of nutmeg, chilli flakes or your own preferred seasoning

","
Method

Peel the potatoes and chop into halves and boil for 7 minutes.


Drain the potatoes and give them time to cool enough for you to be able to hold them without burning yourself! Then grate the potatoes.


Peel and grate the apple and pear and them mix them with the grated potatoes.


You need to get as much moisture out of the mix as you can- squeeze it, pat it with a towel. Add salt and your seasonings.


Separate the mix into 4 equal parts and make circles with them; think burger shaped. Really try and press the mix together to help it bind.


Add enough oil to a frying pan to cover the bottom and fry the rostis for roughly 8-10 minutes each side. But use your judgement here, you want them starting to crisp on the outside.

NOTE: Now in theory the rostis should be done now. However if they are not binding well (and they don’t always) then put them in a preheated oven for 5 minutes to finish them off.

Notes



For the dish size, I used one that’s 18cm x 23cm but sizes can vary slightly.  You may have to adjust cooking times if the overall size is much different as smaller dishes will make a thicker flapjack that may need cooking longer.
If you want to, you can remove the flapjack from the oven about 15 minutes into the cooking time, and carefully turn it out onto a flat baking sheet, so as to cook it more evenly on the underside.  This isn’t essential though, and if you do decide to, be very careful as it will still be quite crumbly.

Ingredients

Vegan chicken nuggets ingredients:
400g firm tofu
80g chickpea flour
5 tbsp nutritional yeast
3 tbsp American mustard
Juice of 1/2 lemon
2 tbsp olive oil
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
Cracked black pepper
Other ingredients:
Breadcrumbs (e.g. gluten-free ones)
On the side:
Potato salad
Ketchup

","
Method
Start squeezing all the water out of 400g of firm tofu. This takes about 20 minutes. The more you squeeze the water out of tofu the more it will absorb flavours.
Then roughly crumble the tofu into a food processor and all other ingredients. Blend well until you get a smooth mixture. You may need to add a TINY bit of water as well. And don’t taste the mixture, the uncooked chickpea flour tastes bitter and needs to be cooked first before it is consumed.
Then spoon out the mixture with a tablespoon. And press into a bowl with breadcrumbs. Bread evenly on all sides and then fry in hot oil until golden brown (make sure the oil is hot). Place on a kitchen towel as it will absorb some of the excess oil.
Serve on its own with ketchup or other dips or with a delicious Austrian potato salad. Enjoy!

Ingredients
For the fruit filling:

4 medium organic apples
150g / 5½ oz blackberries
1 tablespoon agave nectar
Pinch of cinnamon

For the crumble topping:

250g / 9 oz plain flour (wheat, spelt or gluten-free)
150g / 5½ oz vegan margarine, cut into cubes
50g / 2 oz fairtrade demerara sugar, plus a little extra to top
50g / 2 oz porridge oats (use gluten-free if needed)

","
Method

Wash the fruit. Core the apples and chop into cubes, roughly 2cm. Take a third of the chopped apples and simmer in a little water with the agave nectar and cinnamon.
Once they become soft and pulpy and can be lightly mashed with a wooden spoon to form a sauce, add the remaining apples and soften slightly for a couple of minutes.
Remove from the heat and stir in the blackberries gently so as not to crush them.
Pour the fruit mixture into an ovenproof dish and preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/Gas Mark 4.
Meanwhile, rub the vegan margarine into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir in the oats and sugar.
Sprinkle the crumble topping onto the fruit filling and press it down lightly. Scatter a little extra sugar all over the top, then pop in the oven for about 25 minutes.
Serve hot with lashings and lashings of vegan custard!

276,https://veganuary.com/recipes/chilli-cornbread/,Chilli Cornbread,"
Ingredients

2 cups cornmeal
1 cup plain flour
2 tsps baking powder
5g dried chipotle mora chilli
1 pinch pink Himalayan salt
1/3 cup organic coconut oil
2 tblsps maple syrup
2 cups almond milk
2 tsps raw apple cider vinegar or freshly squeezed lemon juice

","
Preparation
Makes 9-12 servings
Equipment

Two mixing bowls
Measuring cups
Measuring spoons
Small pan
Whisk
Wooden spoon
Baking paper
8″ x 8″ baking tray


Method
Turn the oven on to 175c and line your baking dish with baking or greaseproof paper. Melt the coconut oil and leave to cool.
Pour the almond milk and apple cider vinegar or lemon juice into a bowl and whisk together. This will create a ‘buttermilk’, so don’t worry when it starts to curdle or separate.
Finely chop the chilli into tiny pieces and add it with all of the other dry ingredients into another bowl. Stir thoroughly.
* Top Tip *
Wearing disposable gloves helps to avoid any accidental chilli ‘after burn’ if you forget and touch your skin after chopping.
Add the cooled, liquid coconut oil and maple syrup to the ‘buttermilk’ bowl, and whisk briskly for a minute or so to combine and create a slightly frothy mixture.
Pour the liquid into the dry ingredients bowl and stir together until you have a thick batter without any lumps. Pour into the baking dish and pop in the oven for 30-35 mins. To check it’s cooked, insert a skewer into the middle and it should come out clean.
* Serving Suggestion *
The chilli cornbread tastes delicious both warm and cold, and is a great side for soup, chilli con carne, or dipped in flavoured oils and vinegars. The cornbread will keep for 1-2 days in an airtight container, however it always tastes best on the day you make it as gets drier over time; surely a great reason to share it with your friends!

Ingredients

2/3 cup uncooked rice of your choice (I use basmati)
½ cup plant milk
½ cup water
2 large onions, finely cubed
2 cloves garlic, finely cubed
4 1/2 medium-sized zucchini (of 8” length), finely sliced
1 tablespoon Italian Seasoning
¼ cup dried parsley
3/4 cup cashew parmesan
1 teaspoon tomato paste
Salt and pepper
1-2 tablespoons vegan butter
2 tablespoons Nutritional Yeast
For the ‘egg’-mixture:
1 cup chickpea flour
1 cup water
½ teaspoon kala namak (for a hint of eggy flavour)
For the cashew parmesan:
1 cup roasted and salted cashews
1/3 cup nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon shiro miso (optional)

","
Method
Parmesan: Mix all roasted cashews, nutritional yeast and shiro miso in a blender until the mixture has the texture of grated parmesan. If you use unsalted cashews, add a teaspoon of salt to the mixture. I recommend you double or triple the recipe, it keeps in the fridge and you’ll want to use it in other dishes, too.
You can use leftover rice for this, but if you don’t: cook rice according to instructions in plant milk and water. Fry the zucchini slices in batches in a pan in hot oil until they’re soft and start to brown. You can let the zucchini slices drain on paper towel. Sauté onions and garlic in the same pan.
Preheat oven to 200C/390F.
For the ‘egg’-mixture: Mix kala namak and chickpea flour in a bowl. Add the water and whisk until the mixture is smooth and starts to get a little foamy. Add the cashew parmesan and mix well.
Mix cooked rice, parsley, tomato paste, seasoning and onions in a big bowl. Salt and pepper to taste. Add the ‘egg’- mixture. Be aware that uncooked chickpea flour has a strong, unfamiliar taste that will disappear after cooking. It makes it difficult to taste the uncooked mixture, you might want to rely on your experience or salt and pepper before you add the ‘egg’-mixture. Add the fried zucchini slices, mix everything well and fill the mixture in a greased springform tin. Sprinkle with the nutritional yeast, garnish with flakes of butter and bake at 200C/390F for about 50 minutes.
If the quiche browns to quickly, cover the form with tinfoil.
It’s done when the center is firm to the touch.
Serve hot or warm with carrot salad and (vegan) sour cream. I love to eat it when it’s cold, it gets an almost meat-loaf like taste and texture after a night in the fridge.

3–4 tablespoons good-quality olive oil
juice of 1 lemon
pinch of sea salt
freshly ground black pepper

½ red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
grated zest and juice of 1 unwaxed lemon
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
100ml olive oil
teaspoon salt, or more to taste if needed
freshly ground black pepper
","
Method
1. First, make the bulgur salad. Heat a large frying pan over a high heat and add the olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the onion and cook for 1–2 minutes, then stir in the garlic and paprika.
2. Bring the vegetable stock to a simmer in a small saucepan over a medium heat. Add the bulgur wheat and gently cook for 8–10 minutes until the grains have plumped up and are cooked through. Remove from the heat and stir through the red onion mixture and parsley. Set aside.
3. Meanwhile, make the chermoula. Heat a small, dry frying pan over a medium heat, add the cumin and coriander seeds and cook for 2 minutes until just toasted. Transfer to a small mixing bowl, add the remaining chermoula ingredients and mix to combine. Season to taste, then set aside.
4. Preheat the oven to its hottest setting and, once it is roasting hot, turn it to the grill setting. Pierce each aubergine twice with a small, sharp knife. Place on a baking sheet under the grill, with the oven door closed, for 25 minutes or until the aubergine skin is black and the flesh is collapsed and soft, using tongs to turn halfway through this time. Remove from the oven, then slice each hot aubergine lengthways down the centre, being careful not to cut all the way through, and split open. Drizzle with the olive oil and lemon juice, and season with the sea salt and some pepper.
5. Serve the aubergines heaped with a spoonful of the bulgur wheat salad and a spoonful of chermoula.

Ingredients

200g self-raising flour
1 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoons ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon grated nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon of baking powder
60g dairy-free margarine
110g soft light brown sugar
175g mashed ripe bananas
25g chopped walnut pieces
25g raisins
110 ml dairy free milk alternative – this is approximate, you may need less

","
Preparation
Preheat over to 180oC/160oC Fan/Gas 4.

Method

Line a 1lb loaf tin with non-stick baking parchment.


Sift together the flour, ground cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, baking powder in a large mixing bowl. Rub in the dairy-free margarine until you have a consistency of fine breadcrumbs. Add the sugar, bananas, chopped walnuts, and raisins. Stir well.


Gradually add the dairy-free milk a little at a time until you have a soft dropping consistency, the amount needed will depend on the ripeness of the bananas.


Spoon into the tin and level the surface. Bake in the oven for 1¼ to 1½ hours or until golden, firm to touch and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Cover with foil if the loaf is browning too much during cooking.


Leave to cool in the tin then turn out onto a wire rack to finish cooling.

Ingredients

1 tablespoon of finely chopped rosemary
300g (10½ oz) plain oatmeal (ground oats)
½ teaspoon sea salt (or to taste)
175ml – 200ml (6 – 7 floz) approx filtered or spring water
50g (1¾oz) spelt flour or fine oatmeal to roll with
A dash of oil for oven tray

","
Preparation

Finely chop a good handful or more of fresh rosemary leaves, until you have at least a tablespoon of finely chopped rosemary.
Turn oven on to approximately gas mark 7 (220˚C/425˚F).
Mix all dry ingredients together.
Add 175ml (6 floz) of the water and mix thoroughly with the dry ingredients. Add the remaining 25ml of water a little at a time, until you have a dough-like ‘rollable’ ball (the best way to mix is to use the back of a spoon, with a pressing type motion or just get your hands in there). When you have added all water necessary, press firmly together with your hands. You may be tempted to add more water to get it to bind, but make sure that you really need it first, otherwise you’ll end up with a soggy mix! If you put too much water in it’s not really a problem though, just add extra oatmeal or spelt flour.
Split the dough into two (makes rolling easier) and roll out on a flour dusted surface until it is about 3 mm (8th of an inch) thick (I like to use spelt flour or fine oatmeal to roll/dust with, but whatever you have will do).
Cut with cookie cutter and place onto an oiled oven tray. If you don’t have a cookie cutter, then just cut into squares or triangles with a sharp knife.
Place on oven tray and then bake in preheated oven between 20 and 25 minutes, until they begin to gently tan.
Lift from tray and let them cool down on a cooling tray. They should firm up nicely with an enjoyable crunch. Some people like them less crunchy, in which case take out before they start to tan. I am in the ‘crunchy’ camp personally. Explore.

297,https://veganuary.com/recipes/crispy-salt-pepper-spiced-tofu/,Crispy Salt and Pepper Spiced Tofu,"
Ingredients

400g of firm tub tofu (I used Cauldron Original)
1 tsp of Chinese 5-spice (feel free to substitute with your preferred spice)
1-2 tablespoons of vegetable oil (rice bran is good as it has a high smoke point, olive oil works well too)
1 tablespoon of plain flour (if you’re gluten or wheat intolerant, you can substitute for your preferred flour or use gram/chickpea flour)
1 teaspoon of dried chilli flakes (optional) 
Splash of soy sauce
1 sliced chilli, 1 spring onion, few slices of red onion (optional – for garnish)
2 tablespoons of oil (rice brand oil is good as it has a high smoke point but olive oil works well too) 
Salt & pepper
Your favourite vegan dipping sauce – I love sweet chilli with this dish

","
Preparation
I know tofu can be a little daunting to cook with if you haven’t used it before, particularly if you’re a new vegan and attempt to treat it like you might have done a non-vegan protein source.
Top tofu tip! Before we get started it’s probably worth sharing my number 1 favourite tip for tofu – freeze it first, then defrost it.
Whilst this means a little more planning, it seems to make a big difference in the firmness, how easy it is to work with, and also the texture of the end result.  It’s not the end of the world if you haven’t time to freeze it before using but for future reference, I find it works best to keep tofu in the freezer and just take it out to defrost the evening before or the morning of the day I’m going to be using it

Method

Unpackage the tofu and drain well, squeezing the excess moisture over the sink before placing in a clean tea cloth
Wrap the cloth around the tofu and press down on it to remove as much of the moisture as possible – I find placing it between two chopping boards is a good method
Cut the tofu into cubes – I find slicing it in half into two flat slabs is a good way to start
Place the tofu in a bowl, add the salt, pepper, spices, and soy sauce and mix gently until all pieces are evenly coated
Add the flour and mix again, until evenly coated
Heat the oil in a pan, then carefully add the tofu (you don’t want to burn yourself with splashes of hot oil!)
Fry the tofu, turning occasionally, until golden
Serve as is with the garnish or dipping sauce or add at the last minute to your favourite stir fry dish
Enjoy!

Ingredients

1 x 400g tin of aduki beans, drained and rinsed
6 tbsp ground flaxseed
75ml sunflower oil
200g light soft brown sugar
55g cocoa powder
55g ground almonds
1 tsp gluten-free baking powder
100g dark dairy-free chocolate
1 tsp vanilla extract

","
Preparation

Makes 9 brownies
You will need a 23 cm square tin for this recipe


Method
Preheat the oven to 180c and lightly grease and line a 23cm square brownie tin.
Begin by combining the ground flaxseed in a bowl with 9 tablespoons of water, stir together and set aside to thicken up – the flaxseed will absorb all of the liquid, acting as a binder for the brownies.
Place the aduki beans into a food processor and blitz until you have a smooth paste. Add the flaxseed mixture, oil, sugar, cocoa, ground almonds, baking powder and vanilla extract and pulse until you have a rich and glossy batter.
Roughly chop the dark chocolate into small chunks, add it to the mixture and pulse briefly just to combine the chocolate into the mixture. Spoon the brownie batter into the tin and then bake in the oven for 55-60 minutes, stopping half way through to cover the brownies loosely in foil to stop them catching.
Remove from the oven and set aside to cool down until just warm, this way the brownies will have had time to set a little but still be deliciously warm.

1 dudhi
1 tsp salt
70g gram flour
1 tsp garam masala
½ tsp turmeric
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1 green chilli, finely chopped
4 tbsp coriander, finely chopped

Method

Peel and grate the dudhi, then mix with 1 tsp of salt. Leave for 15 minutes.
Using your hands, squeeze the water out of the dudhi and discard the water. This will help each fritter hold together.
Add all spices, chillies and coriander to the dudhi along with the gram flour and cornflour. Mix well to form a coarse batter.
Heat ½ cm of oil in a saucepan over a high heat. Once the oil is hot enough, dot heaped tablespoons of the dudhi batter around the saucepan and fry for 4-5 minutes, turning regularly to ensure they turn evenly crispy.
Once the dudhi is crispy and brown on the outside, remove from the oil and drain on kitchen paper. Serve with a tamarind chutney.

303,https://veganuary.com/recipes/jerk-cauliflower/,Jerk Cauliflower,"
Ingredients

Half a head of cauliflower, broken into bite-size florets
1 – 2 Tbsp Jerk seasoning
2 Tbsp oil
Spring onions, finely chopped
Vegan mayonnaise
Chives to serve

","
Method

Put the florets in a bowl with the oil and then Spread out on a baking tray and put in an oven at 180c for 20 mins. They should soften and brown slightly.


Carefully transfer the cauliflower to a bowl and add as much jerk seasoning as it takes to give your cauliflower a good coating.


Put the cauliflower back on the baking tray and give it another 10 mins in the oven. I like my cauliflower quite well cooked and soft all the way through. Some people prefer cauliflower with more bite, in which case reduce your cooking times accordingly.


Once nicely soft and browned, transfer to serving dish, top with Spring onions and a drizzle of vegan mayo and you’re done.

Vegan Mousse 
300g Soft tofu
100g Dark Chocolate
25g Cocoa powder
70g Maple syrup
Pinch of sea salt

","
Preparation
Vegan Raspberry and Chocolate Crumble

Mix every dry ingredient in a bowl and add the melted vegan butter to bind the mix together.
Spread out evenly on a lined baking tray and cook at 170c for 12-15 minutes.
Once cooled add the raspberry pieces and set aside.
If you wish to prepare this in advance, the crumble can be stored in a airtight container for up to five days.

Caramel Layer (Optional)

Mix the almond milk with the corn starch and warm up gently in a small pan until 50c-60c, set aside.
Heat the sugar in a pan on a medium heat until it reaches a light golden caramel, turn the heat to low and then slowly add the milk, whisking all the time until fully incorporated.
Once all the milk is in, bring the mix to the boil and whisk constantly for 1 minute (this will cook the cornstarch and thicken the mix)
Take off the heat, whisk in the butter until it is emulsified and set aside in a bowl to cool to room temperature.

Vegan Mousse 

Warm the chocolate gently in the microwave and stir with a spoon until melted.
Drain off the tofu and place it into a blender with all the other ingredients, blend until smooth.
Put to one side until you are ready to pour into the glasses (Do not store it in the fridge while you gather the other elements, it will become to firm to pour)

Finishing
Start with pouring a small amount of mousse into the bottom of the glass and layer with the crumble, followed by another layer of mousse.
Place in the fridge to set for 15 minutes before topping with a spoonful of caramel and finishing with more crumble.

313,https://veganuary.com/recipes/cherry-pie/,Cherry Pie,"
Ingredients

8oz/226g plain flour
4oz/113 fat (I used a half/half ratio of vegan butter to vegetable fat)
2oz/56g aquafaba (liquid drained from a can of chickpeas) plus more for brushing
1oz/28g caster sugar
300g cherries, pitted
2 tbsp caster sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract

","
Preparation
Preheat the oven to 350f.
Get a 7 inch pie dish ready.

Method

Start by making the pastry. In a large mixing bowl add the flour and fat. Using your hands rub the fat through the flour until the mixture resembles a coarse sand.


Stir in the sugar. Make a well in the middle of the flour then add the aquafaba, using a wooden spoon to mix it all together.


Lightly flour your kitchen surface, then plop the dough out of the bowl. Knead lightly for around 5 minutes until the pastry is smooth. Roll into a ball and place in a ziplock bag. Chill the pastry in the fridge for at least 1 hour.


Whilst the pastry is chilling, start on the cherry filling. Pit the cherries – I find the easiest way is to use an empty wine bottle and a chopstick. Place 1 cherry in the opening of the wine bottle and use the sharp end of the chopstick to push out the pit.


Once all the cherries are pitted add them to a saucepan with the 2 tablespoons of sugar and vanilla extract. Cook on a medium-low heat until the juices run out and the fruit is soft. Set aside to cool.


Divide the pastry into two equal parts.Flour your surface and roll out one piece of pastry into an 8 inch circle and carefully lay it over the pie dish.


Using your fingers press the pastry into the dish. Cut away the excess pastry. Scoop out the cherries using a slotted spoon, making sure not too take too much of the juice, into the pie casing.


Roll out your second piece of dough and carefully lay it over the top of the pie. Using your thumb press all the way around the edge of the dish to seal the pastry. Cut away the excess pastry. Then using your finger, press the thumb sealed part inwards to make a little flute.


If you want to, you can use your excess pastry to make a little decoration! Cut two slits in the top of the pie crust then brush it with a little aquafaba.


Bake the pie in the oven for 25 minutes or until golden brown, rotating half way.

2 roasted red peppers from a jar (or you can roast your own)
5 cherry tomatoes
1 large clove garlic
1/2 red onion
chopped into 3 chunks
1 cm piece fresh
peeled ginger
Pinch of pink Himalayan salt (or table salt)
Generous pinch of black pepper
1 tsp sugar (optional)
1 tblsp white wine vinegar
1 tblsp balsamic vinegar

","
Preparation
Makes 1 large jar
Equipment

Measuring cups & spoons
Food processor
Frying pan
Wooden spoon
Airtight glass jar
Sieve


Method
Soak the dried chilli and seeds in hot water for 10 mins to soften. When they’re ready, drain into a sieve and tip into the processor.
Add the rest of the ingredients to the food processor and blitz together for 15-20 seconds until everything is chopped into tiny pieces (it doesn’t need to be completely smooth).
Pour the mix into a frying pan and simmer gently on a medium heat for 8-10 mins, so that most of the liquid is absorbed and the flavours intensify. Stir occasionally to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan.
* Top Tip *
Keep an eye on the pan as the timings are just a guide – don’t over simmer the relish or it will dry up and burn.
The relish is ready when the excess liquid has been absorbed but it’s still moist – taste and adjust any seasonings or sweetness to your own taste. Leave to cool and store in an airtight jar.
* Serving Suggestion *
This sweet chilli relish is delicious on crackers, open sandwiches and serves as a great party dip for slices of toasted pitta bread. It’s also perfect for mixing through cooked pasta and veggies to add a spicy twist, plus any other tasty combinations you discover! Store it in the fridge and it will keep for up to 1 week (if you haven’t eaten it all by then!)

318,https://veganuary.com/recipes/beetroot-butterbean-and-mint-dip/,"Beetroot, Butterbean and Mint Dip","
Ingredients

2 beetroot, leaves trimmed
2-3 garlic cloves
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tin butter beans
2 tsp tahini (optional)
Half a lemon, juiced
A handful of fresh mint leaves
1 tbsp walnut oil or olive oil

","
Preparation
Serves 4

Method

Heat the oven to 180C. Wash the beetroots, brush with a little oil and wrap each one in foil. Wrap the garlic cloves into a loose foil parcel and place beets and garlic into the centre of the oven for 45 minutes.
Dry fry the cumin seeds in a non-stick frying pan for a minute or two keeping them moving so they don’t burn. Using a pestle and mortar or spice grinder grind the toasted seeds and set aside.
Reserving the liquid, drain and mash the butterbeans and add in tahini, if using. I mash the beans quite coarsely so as to keep a chunky texture but if you prefer a smoother consistency you might want to use a blender. Once mashed stir in the cumin, lemon juice and season well.
Peel the beetroot and garlic. Cut the beetroot into quarters and place in a blender. Cut the very tips of the garlic cloves and squeeze the soft garlic pulp in with the beetroot. Add a tablespoon of the reserved liquid from the beans and pulse. If the beetroot needs a bit of encouragement to move then add more of the reserved liquid as necessary. Blend until you have a smooth purée. Season to taste.
Coarsely chop the mint leaves and grind in a pestle and mortar with the oil. If you don’t want to use oil then finely chop the leaves and scatter on at the end.
To serve, dollop the bean mixture into a bowl or plate and create a shallow well in the centre. Spoon the beetroot purée into the well and drizzle the mint and oil over the top.

319,https://veganuary.com/recipes/coconut-panna-cotta/,Coconut Panna Cotta,"
Ingredients
For the panna cotta:

400ml or 15 oz regular (i.e. NOT light) canned coconut milk
400 ml or 15 oz coconut cream
100g or 1/2 cup sugar
1 1/4 to 1 1/2 teaspoons of agar agar powder
4 tablespoons cold water
1 fresh vanilla pod

For the raspberry compote:

1 punnet fresh raspberries (c. 250g or 2 cups), washed
Juice of half a small lemon
1 tablespoon water
1/2 tablespoon sugar

","
Preparation

Makes: 5 teacup-sized panna cottas
Preparation time: 10-15 minutes
Cooling and setting time: 4 hours +


Method
First, make the panna cottas. You need to do this way in advance of serving them, at least four hours prior. The panna cottas will keep well overnight, so you can always prepare them the night before you need them, if necessary.

Add 4 tablespoons of cold water to a small bowl. Stir into this 2 teaspoons of agar agar, and set aside for 5 minutes to ‘bloom’.
Add to a saucepan the coconut milk, coconut cream, sugar, and vanilla bean. Bring this mixture to a boil, then whisk in the agar-water mixture. Let the whole thing boil for another minute or so, then sieve into a large mixing bowl.
From the mixing bowl, carefully pour the hot coconut mixture into your serving glasses or dishes. Let the mixture cool for about half an hour before transferring the glasses to your fridge.
Refrigerate the panna cottas for at least 4 hours, until set. Once the panna cottas are cooling you can get to work on the compote.
Add the fresh raspberries, lemon juice, water and sugar to a medium saucepan. Crush up the raspberries a little in the pan with a spoon. Bring this mixture to a boil and allow it to keep boiling for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally.
Then, turn the heat right down. Leave the pan uncovered, on a very low simmer, until most of the water has evaporated and the fruit has cooked down into a nice, smooth compote-y paste. Keep stirring the mixture every 10 minutes or so to help break the raspberries down.
If you’re not a fan of raspberry seeds, sieve your compote before cooling it. Otherwise, simply set it aside for 40-50 minutes, or until your panna cottas are set.
When the compote is cool and your ‘cottas set, scoop on top of each one an even amount of raspberry compote. Serve, preferably as soon as possible, and at most within 2-3 hours of assembling.

Ingredients

For the base:
2 x Cocoa Delight Nakd bars, roughly chopped
For the filling:
75g cashew nuts, soaked for at least an hour
7 dates, pitted and soaked for at least an hour
2tbsp almond milk
1tbsp tahini
1/4tsp vanilla extract
Pinch of ground sea salt
For the topping:
40g dairy-free milk chocolate 
1tbsp coconut oil
1/2 Berry Delight Nakd bar
 

","
Preparation
Makes 2 servings.

Method

Press the Cocoa Delight Nakd bar pieces together with your hands and, using a rolling pin, roll out them until they are 1/2cm thick. You may need to bring them together and roll out again a few times until they form a single piece that can be rolled out without any gaps. Roll out into a rectangle approx. 5cm x 10cm and place in the bottom of suitable container.


In a food processor, blend all of the filling ingredients together into a thick and creamy mixture. Scoop out over the base, smooth out the top, and place in the freezer.


Whilst the filling is in the freezer, roll out the Berry Delight Nakd bar and cut out four small heart shapes. Melt the chocolate and coconut oil over a bain-marie, stirring well. Once smooth and fully melted, remove from the heat and pour over the cheesecake filling. Place the hearts on top and return to the freezer. Freeze for at least ten minutes to allow the topping to set fully.


When you are ready to serve, remove from the freezer and container. Allow to defrost for around ten minutes, then using a very sharp knife, cut into two slices (tip: a sawing action works best to avoid cracking the topping), and serve!

326,https://veganuary.com/recipes/blueberry-lemon-cheescake/,Blueberry Lemon Cheescake,"
Ingredients

For the base:
· 50g rolled oats
· 8 dates, pitted
· 25g sultanas
· 10g sunflower seeds
· 1 tbsp maple syrup
· Zest of 1 organic, unwaxed lemon
· Pinch of Himalayan pink salt
For the filling:
· 75g cashews (pre-soaked in water for at least an hour)
· 100g fresh blueberries
· 1 tsp maple syrup
· Juice of 1 organic, unwaxed lemon
· Seeds of 2 cardamom pods
To decorate:
· 50g fresh blueberries
· Fresh mint leaves (optional)

","
Method

Begin by making the base. Heat a large pan to a medium temperature and gently toast the oats for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. There should be a delicious – but not burning! – aroma.


Combine the oats with the rest of the base ingredients in a food processor. Pulse on a low speed until all the ingredients clump together, but retain a nice texture.


Line a 10cm flan tin with foil.


Scoop out the base mixture and press down evenly into the tin. Place in the freezer.


To make the filling, start by processing the cashews until you have a smooth paste. Next, add 50g of blueberries and the remaining filling ingredients to the processor and blitz until combined.


To assemble, scatter the other 50g of blueberries over the base and then pour on the filling. Smooth over with the back of a spoon, ensuring it goes right up to the edges of the tin.


Freeze, for at least an hour, until needed.

NOTES
The longer you soak the cashews, the smoother (and easier on your food processor) they will be.
Transfer to the fridge a little while before serving to aid slicing.

Ingredients

1 x can of chickpeas
2/3 cloves of garlic
1 lemon
1 x tablespoon of tahini
Olive oil (1/2 tablespoons)
A little water
Salt and pepper to taste

","
Preparation
Special thanks to Victoria Harley for the image: split-pin.co.uk

Method

Remove the skin from your garlic cloves and put into a food processor. Give it a blitz so the garlic is chopped up
Drain and wash your chickpeas and add to processor. Give it another whizz around
Cut your lemon in half and squeeze out all the juice of one half
Add the tahini, olive oil and a splash of water and blitz again (a bit longer this time to give everything a chance to mix)
Scrape down the sides of the processor and give it another blitz
Time for the consistency and flavour check! If the hummus looks too dry, you can add a little more water, oil or lemon juice (or a combination of all three). This is why the tasting part is important, as the lemon can overpower if too much is added. Blitz again
Add salt and pepper to taste and keep processing/adding (water, oil, lemon juice or salt and pepper) until you’re happy with the desired consistency and taste
Pour/spoon out your hummus into a bowl
Serve immediately or leave in the fridge for an hour or two to let the flavours settle (the garlic becomes less strong with time)

¾ -1 cup ground up pecans
½ cup of toasted coconut (sweetened or unsweetened)
½ cup vegan butter
¾ -1 cup of natural peanut butter (crunchy or smooth)
200g dark chocolate
¼ cup of nuts or extra coconut for the tops
","
Method

Put the pecans into a food processor and pulse until it resembles graham cracker crumbs.
In a pan, toast the coconuts on medium heat. Keep an eye on this as they can go from golden brown to black quickly if you are not watching. Stir the coconut around every so often to get even browning. Transfer to a bowl once browned.
Melt the vegan butter over medium heat in a small pot. Stir in the peanut butter, ground pecans, and toasted coconuts. Mix well and then remove from heat.
In a muffin tray (with liners or without – without requires you to use a knife to pop them out later but still works) add 2 tablespoons of the mixture into each cup.
In a glass microwave safe bowl, melt the dark chocolate. Spoon over each one of the cups evenly.
Sprinkle nuts or coconut over the top. (you could even mix it in with the chocolate first!)
Now place the tray into your freezer for 2 hours to set.
After 2 hours remove from the freezer and remove the peanut butter cups! They can be kept in the fridge and eaten right away. I usually wait 5 minutes from when they are taken from the freezer before diving in!

Juice from 1 large orange
1 tsp coconut oil
3 balls of stem ginger, sliced finely into strips
1/2 tsp coconut sugar
Zest from 1 large orange
Black pepper
Optional: ½ tbsp Pulsin protein powder to thicken the sauce

Preparation
Serves 10.

Method

Grease a 7 inch loose-bottomed tart tin with some coconut oil. Cut two 9 inch strips of greaseproof paper and line the tin, one strip over the other. This will make it easier to lift the tart out later.

Mold the raw pastry into the tart tin, building up a rim slightly above the tin. Place in the freezer for 5 – 10 minutes to set.


Make the filling – Roast the cashews in the oven for 2 – 3 minutes until very slightly browned. Melt the Barocco Choco dark chocolate over a bain marie and set aside to cool slightly. Add the rest of the filling ingredients into a food processor and process until thick and creamy. Add the cooled, but melted chocolate into the mixture and process again until combined.


Pour the chocolate cream into the pastry case that you prepared earlier and then put the whole tart back into the freezer for 5 – 10 minutes to set. Gently lift out the tart (you may need to loosen the pastry with a knife) and top with berries and a sprinkling of crumbled pistachios.

4 garlic cloves, roasted
2 tomatoes, roasted
Pinch of chilli powder or smoked paprika

Dip each slice of zucchini first in the flour, then in the butter or flax egg mixture, and finally into the breadcrumbs, coating completely.
Place each coated slice onto a large baking sheet (18×13) lined with parchment paper or foil. Leave a small amount of space between each slice.
Place baking sheet into the oven and bake for 25-35 minutes (flipping every 10 minutes) until golden brown and crispy. Serve with marinara.

338,https://veganuary.com/recipes/french-toast-or-veggy-bread/,French Toast,"
Ingredients

Brine/aquafaba from one can of cannellini/navy beans
1 tsp Vegg vegan egg yolk substitute, made up as directed*
3/4 tsp salt
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp finely ground pepper
3 tbsp white sugar
Flavourless vegetable oil for frying
6 slices of your favourite bread (seeded bread is good as the seeds get beautifully caramelised)
Maple syrup to serve
*If you don’t have Vegg use 3/4 tsp nutritional yeast and 1/4 black salt whisked into 30mls water

","
Method

Switch your oven on and put the tray inside. This is to keep cooked slices warm while cooking more.
Whisk the brine/aquafaba until it reaches ribbon stage (around 4-5 mins in a stand mixer on med-high speed).
Add the yolk mix (if it is very stiff, add a little more water – it should be the consistency of washing up liquid) and salt and pepper. Continue whisking for another minute.
Add the sugar 1 tbsp at a time, making sure it is well combined each time.
Transfer to the flat bottomed dish. Cut your bread in half diagonally. Place 4 pieces in the aquafaba mix. Turn to coat both sides. It won’t sink into the bread very much but that’s OK.
Heat your pan to med-hot, pour in a tbsp of veg oil and pop your slices in. Do not try to move them until the aquafaba mix looks melted on the top side.
Using a spatula, you may need to work a little to separate the slice from the pan. Flip and do the same again. Each side should be golden brown.
Put slices in oven to keep warm. Serve with maple syrup.

342,https://veganuary.com/recipes/gooey-pecan-pie/,Gooey Pecan Pie,"
Ingredients

For the pastry:
250g / 9 oz plain flour (wheat, spelt or gluten-free), plus extra for dusting
125g / 4½ oz vegan margarine, cut into cubes, plus extra for greasing
Ice-cold water
For the filling:
450g / 1lb golden syrup
50g / 2 oz fairtrade soft brown sugar
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
125g / 4½ oz granary breadcrumbs
175g / 6 oz toasted pecan nuts, roughly chopped
To decorate:
Whole pecan nuts

","
Method
To make the pastry, sieve the flour into a large bowl and rub in the cubes of vegan margarine with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Work quickly and with a light touch to avoid the fat melting. Check for any remaining lumps of margarine by shaking the bowl to bring them to the surface.
Make a well in the centre of the mixture and add some chilled water, a little at a time. Lightly work the mixture to form a ball, adding a sprinkle of flour if the mixture is too wet, or a touch more water if it’s too dry. Cover and chill for 20-30 minutes.
Grease a 9” fluted flan tin, preferably with a removable base. Roll the pastry out thinly on a lightly floured surface and line the tin. For an extra finishing touch, you can crimp the edge with your thumb. Prick over the pastry case with a fork, to prevent the base puffing up during baking. Cover and return to the fridge while you prepare the filling.
Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/Gas Mark 6 and put in a heavy baking tray to heat through. Baking the pie on a hot baking sheet will ensure a crisp base to the pastry case.
To make the filling, gently warm the syrup over a low heat, making sure it doesn’t boil. Stir in the brown sugar and vanilla extract.
Remove from the heat and add the breadcrumbs and chopped pecans. Add a few more breadcrumbs if the mixture seems a bit runny.
Pour the mixture into the pastry case and level the surface. Decorate the top with the whole pecan nuts, placing them in concentric circles.
Bake the pie on the preheated baking tray for about 10 minutes until the pastry has started to colour, then reduce the oven temperature to 180ºC/350ºF/Gas Mark 4. If the pecans appear to be getting too dark brown, cover the pie with foil.
Continue baking for a further 25-30 minutes until the pastry is golden and the filling is lightly firm and set. The top should be chewy and the middle soft and moist, with the pecans nice and crunchy.
Remove from the oven and leave in the tin to cool a little and firm up. Serve your pie warm or cold. You could add a dash of maple syrup to your favourite vegan cream or ice cream alternative to accompany this wonderfully gooey treat.

Ingredients

1 tsp psyllium husks, or 1 T flax seeds
4 Tbsp water
200g plain white flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
½ t baking powder
½ tsp fine sea salt
100g vegan butter, at room temperature
100g caster sugar
100g light brown sugar
2 Tbsp soy milk
130g smooth peanut butter (try to use 100% peanut varieties if you can)
50g light tahini
160g vegan dark chocolate
2 Tbsp white sesame seeds
Pinch flaky sea salt

","
Method

In a small bowl whisk together the ground psyllium husks/ground flax seeds with the water. Set aside to thicken into your egg mixture.
In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the vegan butter, sugars, soy milk and psyllium/flax egg mixture until smooth and fluffy. Add the peanut butter and tahini and beat for another few minutes.
Add the flour mixture and beat gently until just combined. Finally add the chocolate chips, reserving a small handful for decorating the top of the cookies later.
Cover the dough with cling film and place in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 170c and line two baking trays with baking parchment.
Using a cookie dough scoop or a tablespoon, place scoops of dough around the size of walnuts on the prepared baking trays with a few inches between each cookie. You should fit 10 per tray.
Top each cookie with a couple of the reserved chocolate chips. Sprinkle the tops of the cookies with the sesame seeds and the flaky sea salt.
Gently press down each ball of dough with a fork. Don’t worry about making a pattern or design on top – this will disappear as they bake.
Bake for 20 minutes, being careful not to let the cookies burn on the edges. Remove from the oven and leave to cool fully on a wire cooling rack.
Once cooled, serve and enjoy!

344,https://veganuary.com/recipes/low-carb-carbonara/,Low Carb Carbonara,"
Ingredients

SAUCE INGREDIENTS
150g raw cashews (soaked for 4 hr or overnight)
160ml cold water
200g soft tofu, diced
2 tbsp of nutritional yeast 
3 tbsp of good quality wholegrain mustard
Optional: 1 1/2 tbsp protein powder (soya bean or pea protein powder work well).
Pinch of nutmeg
Salt and pepper
OTHER INGREDIENTS
1 tbsp coconut oil
3 plump garlic cloves, crushed
3 rashers of diced vegan bacon
700g courgette, ideally spiralised
250g edamame/soya beans
250g button mushrooms, sliced
To garnish: freshly chopped herbs (I have used parsley in the photos pictures, but torn basil leaves are also a lovely alternative) and a sprinkle of ground flaxseed if desired.

","
Method
 

Soak the raw cashews for 4 hours or overnight (the cashews will plump up!), drain away the water and place the soaked cashews in a blender or food processor.


Add the remaining sauce ingredients and blend for a few seconds to form a creamy sauce.


Spiralise your courgettes. If you do not have a spiraliser, vegetable peeler peelings can be used.


In a big non-stick pan, melt the coconut oil. Add crushed garlic and vegan bacon. Sauté for about 3 mins before adding in the spiralised courgettes, mushrooms and edamame beans. Continue cooking for about 6-8 mins to cook through and to evaporate as much moisture as possible (this prevents the final sauce from becoming too watery).


Add the carbonara sauce to the vegetables and cook though for 4-5 mins. Serve, garnishing with fresh herbs and ground flaxseed to boost the nutritive profile.

FOR THE DRESSING:
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar

Preparation
Serves 4

Method

Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6 and roast the cherry tomatoes for 10 minutes.
Cover the bottom of a pan with cold water and place a steamer above it. Put the broccoli, green beans and carrots in the steamer, turn the heat on quite high and steam for about 15 minutes, occasionally prodding the carrots with a fork to see if they are done. Some people like them slightly crunchy, others prefer them a little softer.
While the vegetables are steaming, make a salad with the leaves and spring onions.
Combine the polenta and herbs in a bowl. Heat some olive oil in a frying pan. Dip the tofu in the polenta mixture, then fry until golden.
Whisk together the ingredients for the dressing, but only pour over at the last minute.
Assemble your meal by first putting the salad on the plate, then the warm vegetables and finally the tofu. Pour over the dressing then add a little seasoning sauce such as Braggs or a sauce of your choice.

Small pinch of sea salt
Agar-agar flakes (1 level tablespoon of flakes per cup of liquid) 
Some fresh berries, such as raspberries, strawberries (if not in season, use frozen)

Ingredients

2-3 tbsp olive oil
400g Meatless Farm Co mince
1  medium red onion diced
2-3 sticks celery, diced (optional)
3  garlic cloves, peeled & minced
400g chopped tomatoes with liquid
4 tbsp chipotle in adobo minced
4 green onions thinly sliced
1 handful coriander roughly chopped
6 large flour tortillas
500g vegan cheese
*Serve with cashew sour cream, lime, coriander, avocado, etc.

","
Preparation

Place a large pan over medium heat with 2-3tbsp of oil, and cook the onions until soft and tender, for about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Add the chipotle peppers and the diced tomatoes with their liquid. Stir frequently and cook until the sauce thickens and the liquid has mostly evaporated, for about 20 minutes. Stir in The Meatless Farm Co mince, green onions and coriander. Reduce the heat to low, enough to keep the mixture warm.
Heat a clean grill pan on medium heat. We like to put a touch of oil in the pan to make the tortilla extra crispy, but that’s not necessary, it’s just a matter of preference. Place the tortilla on a hot grill, cover with a layer of cheese, then spread some of The Meatless Farm Co chipotle mixture over half. Once the cheese has melted, fold the tortilla over to make your quesadilla. Repeat with remaining tortillas, they can be kept warm in the oven until you’re ready to serve. Allow them to rest for a couple of minutes before slicing to ensure everything doesn’t ooze out.
Serve with fresh lime slices, cashew sour cream, avocado slices and extra coriander.

Ingredients

150g (1 1/4 c) wholemeal flour
1tsp baking powder
2tbsp lucuma powder or brown sugar
2 chia “eggs” (1 egg = 1tbsp milled chia seeds mixed with 3tbsp water to form a gel)
1tsp vanilla bean paste
215ml almond milk or dairy-free milk of your choice
60g (4 tbsp) dairy-free margarine, melted
500g (about 1 pound) apples (pre coring), spiralised, grated or cut into thin strips
1tsp ground cinnamon
2tbsp water

","
Preparation

Mix the flour, baking powder and lucuma together in a large bowl.


In a separate bowl, mix the chia eggs and vanilla bean paste together. Add the almond milk a little at a time, stirring well, until it has combined with the chia mix.


Create a hole in the middle of the dry ingredients and slowly begin to pour in the chia mix, stirring constantly to form a batter. Be careful not to mix the batter any more than necessary – it doesn’t need to be completely smooth. Now add the melted butter and gently mix in.


Set the batter aside for ten minutes.


In the meantime, add the spiralised apple, cinnamon and water into a large pan. Heat over a medium high heat and simmer for ten minutes until the apples are soft.


Set the waffle maker to heat up.


Gently mix the apples into the waffle batter and scoop around a quarter (depending on the size of your waffle maker) of the mix onto the iron. Press and cook according to your machine and preference (I chose a medium setting).


Once cooked and golden brown, remove the waffle from the machine and place on a piece of kitchen paper to prevent it becoming soggy.


Repeat the process for each waffle.


Serve with plant-based honey, syrup or a caramel sauce.

For the ‘meatballs’
1 x 400g tinned red kidney beans (drained and rinsed)
1/2 red onion roughly chopped
2 garlic cloves
35g oats
30g walnuts
4 tbsp nutritional yeast
1 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
Small handful of fresh basil
For the sauce
1/2 red onion sliced
1 carrot diced
120ml vegan red wine
120ml vegetable stock
300g Tideford Organics Tomato & Basil Sauce (or similar)
Oil for frying
","
Method

Preheat the oven to 200°C and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper unless you’re using a non stick tray.
Add the meatball ingredients to a food processor and process the ingredients together until the mixture reaches a rough consistency, ensuring some larger pieces remain. It’s really important you avoid processing the ingredients for too long, otherwise the meatballs will turn into a mush!
Take roughly a tbsp of the mixture in your hand and roll it into a ball, then place it on the baking tray. Repeat until all the mixture has been used up and you’re left with 12 balls.
Transfer the baking tray to the oven and bake the balls for 20 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the sauce by first adding a little oil to a frying pan on a medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the red onion and fry for 3 minutes. Then add the carrot and fry for a further 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Next, add the wine to the pan and simmer on a low heat for 5 minutes.
Then add the vegetable stock, sauce, and finally add the meatballs to the pan. Simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the sauce has started to thicken.
Remove the pan from the hob and serve. We recommend serving with mashed potato and a sprinkle of basil. Enjoy!

250g steamed brown Basmati rice
4 x skewers
1 tbsp tikka masala paste
225g firm smoked tofu
½ tsp turmeric
80g coconut yoghurt
","
Method
Preheat the oven to 220C/fan200C/gasmark 7.
Drain the tofu and pat dry with a paper towel, then cut into 12-16 equal cubes. Heat a non-stick frying pan with 1tbsp oil on a medium-high heat. Add the tofu and cook for 5-7mins, stirring occasionally, until golden brown.
Meanwhile,make the tikka marinade. Peel the garlic and grate or finely chop. Cut the lime in half. Place the garlic into  a small bowl followed by half the coconut yoghurt, the tikka masala paste, juice from half the lime and a pinch of sea salt. Mix well.
When the tofu is cooked, thread 3-4 cubes onto each skewer. Place all the skewers onto a baking tray or in an ovenproof dish. Spoon the tikka marinade evenly over the tofu to coat, then bake in the oven for 7 mins.
Roughly chop the kale. To the same frying pan used to cook the tofu, add the rice, turmeric, kale, 2 tbsp water and a pinch of sea salt and black pepper. Cook on a medium heat for 5 mins, until the rice is hot and the kale has wilted.
Make the red cabbage and apple slaw. Very finely slice the red cabbage and roughly chop the coriander leaves. Cut the apple in half and grate half of it, leaving the skin on (enjoy the second half as a snack!). Place the red cabbage, grated apple and coriander into a small bowl. Add the remaining coconut yoghurt and the juice from the remaining half lime. Stir to combine and season with sea salt.
Spoon the turmeric rice and kale into warm bowls. Serve with the red cabbage and apple slaw. Place the baked tofu skewers on top.

387,https://veganuary.com/recipes/shabu-shabu/,Vegan Shabu Shabu,"
Ingredients
The broth:
60g dried kombu
2 litres cold water
 
 
Ponzu dipping sauce:
2 tsp sugar
2 tbsp lime juice
4 tbsp orange juice
1 tbsp mirin (rice wine)
1 tbsp soy sauce
 
 
The platter:
Create a platter for each person, from any ingredients you like, perhaps:
Firm tofu
Cabbage, chopped
Spring onion, sliced
Carrots, sliced
Mushrooms, especially the exotic kinds!
Baby corn
Yams, diced
Udon noodles, frozen
","
Method

The night before, make the broth by wiping the kombu with a clean cloth, then steeping in cold water overnight. Remove the seaweed, retaining the broth. (If short of time, steep the kombu in the water for 30 mins, then heat to near-boiling but DO NOT let it boil!)
Combine all the dipping sauce ingredients and refrigerate.
When you are ready to eat, place the broth in a pan on the portable stove and bring it to a gentle boil. Start adding ingredients from the platter. Vegetables like carrots and cabbage take a little longer to cook, so put some of those in first, then the tofu, and pick them back out when they are done! Keep adding ingredients from your platter. Don’t worry – it is very hard to get this wrong!!
As the tofu and vegetables come out of the pot, dip them in the sauce and eat straight away.

1kg (2 lb.) potatoes, sliced
1 onion chopped
250g (2 1./2 cups) of chickpea flour (also known as garbanzo or gram flour)
Salt and pepper to season
Olive oil
Cold water

","
Method



Shallow fry the onions and potatoes for around five minutes, or until the potatoes begin to soften, remove from the oil and place aside in a bowl
Put chickpea flour in a bowl and slowly add cold water while mixing until you get a consistency similar to pancake batter, pour over the potatoes and onions, season with salt and pepper and mix well
Pour the mixture back into your reasonably well-oiled frying pan and cook over medium heat or until the edges and top begin to solidify
Here comes the fun part! Take a dinner plate, run it quickly under the tap to dampen it, place it over the top of your frying pan and tip then tip the pan upside down so that the tortilla ends up on your plate
Gently slide the tortilla back into the pan, sometimes it will need a little encouragement from a spoon or spatula as it won’t be firm, don’t worry, this is normal!
Cook for another few minutes, let cool and enjoy!

2 packs Like Meat Breaded Chicken (180g x 2)
Vegan honey BBQ sauce (recipe below)
Vegetables of choice, for example red pepper, red onion, courgette and baby tomatoes.
Vegan Honey BBQ Sauce:
200g ketchup
100g vegan honey, alternatively use agave or maple syrup
50g cider vinegar
3 tsp brown sugar
1 tsp liquid smoke
1 tsp paprika
½ tsp chilli powder
1 tsp onion powder
¾ tsp garlic powder
½ tsp salt
½ tsp ground black pepper
A little vegetable oil
","
Method
Defrost the Like Breaded Chicken fillets.
Make the Vegan Honey BBQ Sauce:
Measure out ketchup, honey, vinegar and brown sugar into a small saucepan and heat gently, stirring until smooth. Stir the liquid smoke and the rest of the ingredients into the ketchup mixture, reduce heat to low, and simmer until thickened, about 20 minutes.
While the sauce is simmering, chop your veggies chunkily. Toss in a little oil to coat.
Carefully cut each Like Breaded Chicken fillet into 5-6 pieces with a sharp knife and place in a large bowl/tub.
When the Vegan Honey BBQ Sauce is ready, drizzle it over the Like Breaded Chicken pieces and stir gently to ensure they’re evenly coated.
Thread veggies and the sauce coated Like Breaded Chicken pieced onto skewers. (If using wooden skewers, wet them first to avoid them burning when grilling.)
Cook skewers on the barbecue for around 20 mins until piping hot, turning regularly, and veggies are nicely charred round the edges.
If the weather is not right for a barbecue, you can cook the dish in an oven proof tray in the middle of the oven, pre-heated to 200°c.
Serve the Like Breaded Chicken skewers with a fresh summer salad and boiled new potatoes, tossed in plant based butter and topped with chopped fresh chives.

393,https://veganuary.com/recipes/whole-roasted-coconut-cauliflower/,Whole Roasted Coconut Cauliflower,"
Ingredients
For the Coconut Paste:
4 spring onions, roughly chopped
1 green chilli, deseeded and roughly chopped
1 small bunch of coriander, stalks and leaves separated, leaves reserved for scattering over the cauliflower, stalks roughly chopped
4 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped
1 small thumb of fresh root ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
2 teaspoons ground turmeric or 1 small thumb of fresh turmeric, peeled and roughly chopped
1 tablespoon cumin seeds, toasted
1 tablespoon coriander seeds, toasted
400ml can coconut milk
For the Coconut Cauliflower:
500g baby potatoes, larger ones halved
1 large cauliflower (about 750g)
4 kaffir lime leaves
4 tablespoons coconut oil
juice of 1 lime
1 teaspoon coriander seeds, bashed with a pestle and mortar or rolling pin
100g curly kale, washed
2 red chillies, deseeded and finely chopped, plus 1 extra, cut into slivers, for garnish (but this is optional!)
salt and freshly ground black pepper
","
Method
1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/Gas Mark 6.
2. First, make the coconut paste. Using a food processor or stick blender, blitz the spring onions, green chilli, coriander stalks, garlic, ginger, turmeric and cumin and coriander seeds with half the can of coconut milk until a rough paste forms.
3. Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil, lower in the potatoes and boil or 15 minutes or until a sharp knife passes through them easily. Drain and set aside.
4. Place the cauliflower in a deep roasting tin and pour the remaining coconut milk around it. Scatter the kaffir lime leaves over the coconut milk. Rub 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil over the cauliflower and season well with salt and pepper. Then use a spatula or spoon to rub the spice paste all over the cauliflower, getting into every crevice of each floret. Squeeze the lime juice over the cauliflower. Cover the tin tightly with foil, place on the middle shelf of the oven and roast the cauliflower for 20 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons coconut oil in a separate shallow roasting tin on the top shelf of the oven above the cauliflower for a couple of minutes. Carefully remove the tin from the oven, arrange the potatoes in a single even layer in the hot oil and use a potato masher to press down on them just to split their skins. Scatter the mustard and coriander seeds over the top, season well with salt and pepper and roast on the top shelf for 45 minutes until the potatoes are crispy and golden all over.
6. Once the cauliflower has roasted for 20 minutes, lift the foil away and baste the top with the bubbling, spiced coconut milk from the tin. Roast, uncovered, for a further 25–30 minutes until the top of the cauliflower is crispy and charring.
7. When the roasted potatoes are done, remove the tin from the oven, scatter the kale and chopped red chillies over the potatoes and stir to coat in the flavoured oil. Roast for 5 minutes until the kale is just starting to wilt but is still bright green.
8. Lift the kale and potatoes out of the tin with a slotted spoon and arrange on a large platter. Place the cauliflower in the centre of the platter and spoon over any bright yellow liquid from the tin. Scatter over the reserved coriander leaves. At the table, use a serrated knife to slice the cauliflower into bold wedges and, if you want extra heat, garnish with the slivers of bright red chilli.

394,https://veganuary.com/recipes/roasted-celeriac-caraway-soup-herb-caper-croutons/,Roasted Celeriac and Caraway Soup with Herb and Caper Croutons,"
Ingredients

For the soup:
1 medium celeriac (approx. 900g before peeling)
1 large onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tsp caraway seeds
Bouquet garni of bay, rosemary and sage 
600ml vegetable stock, preferably homemade
100ml soya milk (or other dairy free milk)
For the croutons:
100g stale bread cut into very small cubes
2 cloves garlic, chopped finely
Zest of a lemon
A large handful of parsley-or a selection of herbs that you like
1 tbsp capers
4 tbsps extra virgin olive oil
Salt and pepper

","
Preparation
Serves 4-6 | Dietary: Vegan, Wheat Free (without the croutons)

Method
Soup:

Pre heat the oven to 200c/ gas mark 6.
Peel the celeriac using a sharp peeler and remove any areas where the roots are still visible.
Chop into 1 cm cubes and place in a roasting tin with a splash of rapeseed or vegetable oil.
Roast the celeriac for 25 minutes or until it is softened and golden around the edges. Add the caraway seeds and return to the oven for another five minutes.
While the celeriac is roasting heat a little oil in a large sauce pan and gently cook the onion, until it is really soft and starting to caramelise. Add the garlic and fry for another 5 minutes.
Add the roasted celeriac, bouquet garni and caraway to the onion mixture and stir well.
Pour on the stock and soya milk and simmer for 5 minutes.
Remove the bouquet garni and blend until smooth with a hand blender. Taste, season and serve

Tip: A bouquet garni is a small bunch of herbs that you add to soups and stews to infuse the dish with flavour-it is removed before serving. Traditionally the herbs are “hard herbs” such as bay, rosemary, sage, thyme, all of which grow well in the British winter. You can tie them together with clean string (you can buy cooking string from kitchen shops) or use a heatproof plastic freezer clip-one that has been washed in a hot dishwasher or placed in boiling water before use to sterilise.
Croutons:

Preheat the oven to 200c/ gas mark 6
Heat a roasting dish in the oven. Add the oil and then the bread and mix well.
Cook in the oven for approximately 10 minutes and then add the chopped garlic and stir in. Return to the oven and roast for another 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally so that the bread is crispy and golden.
Finely chop the herbs and capers together with the lemon zest.
Add the chopped herbs to the crispy croutons and mix together. Taste and add pepper (you probably won’t need salt as the capers are salty already)
Use to garnish the soup-any leftovers can be stored in an airtight box in the fridge and will keep for about 3 days.

Tips: These croutons are a great way of using up stale bread-they are traditionally made with sourdough or ciabatta style bread. You can also use a wheat free or spelt bread. Croutons on their own (without added herbs) will keep for weeks in a sealed container out of the fridge-once you add fresh herbs they won’t last so long and need to be kept cold. If you like things spicy add some flaked chilli to the croutons. Croutons don’t need to be just for soup-they are also great added to pasta dishes, rice or salads. Vary the herbs that you use – parsley is ideal but basil, chives, dill, sorrel and coriander would also work.

Ingredients

1/2 tbsp coconut oil
2 medium red onion, finely diced
3 litres vegetable stock
2 large red peppers, finely sliced into 2 cm bite-size slices
1-2 red chillies sliced finely (depending how hot you like your soup! Reserve a few slices for the garnish)
Optional: 2 tbsp Pulsin protein powder (soya or pea varieties work well), 1 tbsp milled chia seeds
To garnish: freshly chopped parsley and a few slices of red chilli
2 cloves of garlic, crushed
5 large sweet potatoes (approx. 1kg), roughly chopped into 2-2.5cm chunks
200g sweet corn kernels
4 spring onions, finely sliced. Reserve some for the garnish
3 tbsp cashew cream or coconut cream. Alternatively, 30g of silken tofu.
Salt and pepper to taste

","
Method

In a deep-bottomed pot, melt the coconut oil. Add the crushed garlic, chopped onions and sweet potato chunks and sauté for 5 mins.


Add the stock and bring to the boil.


Simmer the soup for approx. 13 mins until the vegetables are all soft (you can check this by poking a fork through a couple of the sweet potato chunks).


Remove from the heat. If using silken tofu or protein powder add this now and blend to make a creamy soup. (A hand-blender is great for this!)


Return the blended soup to the hob and on a low heat stir in the sweet corn, sliced peppers, most of the chopped chilli and spring onions. Stir for about 3-4 mins until cooked through.


Stir in the cashew cream or coconut cream, if using.


Stir in the milled chia seeds or protein powder if using.


Season to taste with freshly ground black pepper and salt.


Ladle into bowls and garnish with chopped spring onion, a few slices of chopped chilli and some finely chopped parsley. Enjoy!

To transform this soup into a chowder, you have options! You can add coconut cream, cashew cream or silken tofu – they all work well!

399,https://veganuary.com/recipes/peach-pastries-danish/,Peach Pastries Danish,"
Ingredients

For the Custard Filling
250ml plant milk (oat is best)
1/2 tsp vanilla bean paste
50g icing sugar
30g corn starch
pinch turmeric powder
20g vegan butter
For the Peach Halves
3 peaches (or six canned peach halves)
For the Pastries
375g pack pre-rolled puff pastry (make sure it’s plant-based)
4 Tbsp plant milk
1 tsp vegetable oil
½ tsp agave syrup (or maple syrup)
For Finishing
80g icing sugar
3 tsp plant milk
5 Tbsp unsalted pistachios, roughly chopped

","
Method
To Make the Custard

In a small saucepan, combine 200ml of the plant milk, vanilla bean paste, and icing sugar. Whisk well to combine and place over a low heat.
Place the remaining 50ml of plant milk in a small bowl and add the cornstarch and turmeric powder. Whisk well until smooth and no lumps remain.
Gradually whisk the cornstarch mixture into the warmed plant milk. Keep whisking constantly over low heat until the mixture thickens dramatically. Once thickened, leave the mixture to bubble a couple of times before removing from the heat and vigorously whisking in the vegan butter.
Pour the custard into a baking tray (this will allow it to cool more quickly) and cover with cling film, making sure the film is making contact with the surface of the custard.
Once cooled to room temperature, refrigerate the custard for a minimum of 20 minutes.

To Peel the Peaches

If using fresh peaches rather than canned, fill a large bowl with ice cold water.
Place a medium saucepan over medium heat and bring to the boil. Once boiling, remove the pan from the heat and carefully drop the peaches into the water. Leave them there for maximum three mins or until the skins start to split.
Use a slotted spoon to remove the peaches from the hot water and put them straight into the cold water to stop them from cooking.
The skin should slip off easily, but if not, you may need to use a vegetable peeler to start the process.
Once peeled, halve the peaches and remove the stones. Set aside.

To Make the Pastries

Preheat the oven to 200c fan.
Remove the pastry from the fridge and carefully unroll onto a baking tray lined with parchment (if the end of the pastry is a little still and doesn’t want to unroll, leave it to warm up for 2 minutes).
Remove the custard from the fridge and transfer it to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on high speed until smooth again. If you don’t have a stand mixer, beat with a whisk until smooth.
Divide the dough into 6 squares using a pizza cutter (for me each square was 12.5cm).
In a cup, mix together the plant milk, oil, and syrup. This will be your “egg wash”.
Using a pastry brush, apply a small amount of egg wash to the centre of each square.
Fold the corners of the square into the centre and push them down gently to stick.
Add a heaped tablespoon of custard to the centre of each pastry square. Follow with a peach half and push down gently to make sure the custard squeezes out further than the peach half.
Brush the pastry with the egg wash and place in the oven for 15-20 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown.

To Finish

Whisk together the icing sugar and plant milk until smooth and thick enough to drizzle off the whisk.
Drizzle the icing over the pastries.
Sprinkle the pistachios over the pastries before serving.

Add 2 tablespoons of water to the flax and leave to one side. Whilst that is thickening, sift together the flour, salt, baking powder and tablespoon of sugar, then rub in the oil until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
Add the flax mixture and knead until it becomes a firm but pliable dough. Put into the tin and press to cover the bottom evenly.
Brush a thin layer of apple sauce onto the dough, then cut the apples into thin slices and layer them on top. Use the rest of the apple sauce to cover the apple slices.
Mix together the oats, sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle on top of the apples.
Bake for 1 hour.
Leave in the tin for 10 minutes, then carefully transfer to a cooling rack.
Can be eaten warm with a big scoop of coconut milk ice cream or left to cool.

406,https://veganuary.com/recipes/wicked-serious-carbonara/,Wicked Serious Carbonara,"
Ingredients
FOR THE ALFREDO-STYLE CREAM SAUCE:

1 Cup / 200g raw cashews, soaked for a few hours and rinsed (If you’re short on time, boil the raw cashews with the cauliflower in the first step in the directions below.)
400g Cauliflower (roughly 1 head) cleaned and dismembered into large pieces
5 garlic cloves, peeled
pinch of salt
1 bay leaf
3 cups water
1/4 cup / 50g pine nuts, toasted (optional)
1 Tbsp white miso paste (optional)
1 tsp salt
32 oz / 900ml unsweetened soy milk (or your favourite non-dairy milk)

FOR THE MUSHROOMS:

2 cups / 400g shiitake mushrooms, sliced
3 Tbsp olive oil
3/4 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp black pepper

FOR THE CARBONARA:

1 lb / 450g fresh fettuccini
3 Tbsp olive oil
1/2 large onion, medium diced
2 cloves garlic, sliced thin
1/2 cup / 100g peas, fresh or frozen

GARNISH:

Small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, leaves picked, lightly packed
cracked black pepper
coarse salt

","
Method

In a large sauce pot add cashews (if you didn’t soak them), cauliflower, garlic, a pinch of salt, bay leaf and 3 cups of water. Cover and bring to a slow boil over a medium-high heat.
Cook for 10-15 minutes or until the cauliflower easily breaks apart. Strain and remove bay leaf.
Transfer mixture to a high-speed blender (add cashews at this point if you pre-soaked them). Add pine nuts, miso and salt. Begin blending on low-speed while slowly adding the soy milk. Once incorporated, blend on high for couple minutes until the mixture is silky smooth.
Set aside half of the mixture for this recipe and save the remaining mixture in a closed container in the fridge for up to a week for other use.

To make the mushrooms

Preheat oven to 375.
Add sliced shiitakes to a small bowl and toss with 1 T of the oil, smoked paprika and pinch of black pepper. In a large oven-safe skillet, heat 2 Tbsp oil on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Add shiitake mushrooms and sauté for 2 minutes, then transfer pan directly to oven and finish roasting for 10 minutes. Remove and transfer the mushrooms to a paper towel to allow to drain and crisp up.

To complete the dish

Cook fettuccine al dente according to the package instructions, set aside.
Heat large sauce pot on medium heat until hot, then add oil, onions and sliced garlic cloves and sauté for 3 minutes until they begin to brown. Add a splash of water (or white wine if handy) to loosen, then half of the alfredo-style sauce, peas and mushrooms.
Heat for 1 minute then add pasta and stir to coat.
Remove from heat and garnish with the parsley, black pepper and salt, to taste.

Helpful Tip: while preparing this, we cooked the pasta ahead of time, and when it was time to add the pasta to the sauce we boiled a small pot of water and poured it over the cooled pasta to loosen and bring it up to temp before adding to the heating sauce.

407,https://veganuary.com/recipes/tofu-shallot-satay-with-kale-crispy-seaweed/,Tofu Shallot Satay with Crispy Kale,"
Ingredients

For the skewers:
1 block of firm tofu, I used Cauldron which I freeze, defrost, drain and press. 
2 Tbsp tamari
1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil
12 shallots, peeled
6 skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes, this stops them from burning in the oven
For the marinade:
1 Tbsp tamari
Juice of 1 lime
1 garlic clove, finely grated
1 red birdseye chilli, finely chopped
2 Tbsp peanut butter, either chunky or smooth
1 spring onion, finely chopped
For the crispy ‘seaweed’
65g kale, stalk removed and shredded
1tsp tamari
1t date syrup
1tsp sesame seeds

","
Preparation
Serves 2.
Preheat your oven to 200c.

Method

Cut the tofu into 12 cubes, put this into a tupaware box with 2T tamari and 1T sesame oil.


Put the lid on and move the box around so that the tofu is covered.


Set to one side whilst you peel the shallots and make the marinade.


To make the marinade put the tamari, lime juice, garlic, chilli and peanut butter in a glass or cup and mix well. You might need to smush the pb with a fork, as it’s a fat it can resistant to mixing. But keep smushing and it will eventually concede and play nice.


Add the shallots and marinade to the tofu and again put the lid on and move about until all of the tofu and shallots are covered in the sauce.


Put 2 cubes of tofu and 2 shallots on each skewer, place on a baking tray, spoon any remaining sauce on and put them into the oven.


To make the crispy ‘seaweed’ put the kale in a bowl, add the tamari and date syrup, massage the kale until it has softened and it is covered with the sauce.


Put the kale on a baking tray, spreading it out so it is one layer only.


Sprinkle this with the sesame seeds and put the tray into the oven.


Bake the skewers for around 20 minutes, the edges of the tofu will brown and the skin of the shallots will blister.


Bake the kale for just 5 minutes, until it crisps up but before it becomes burnt!!


Serve with a scattering of spring onion on the skewers.

408,https://veganuary.com/recipes/oreo-chocolate-cheesecake/,Oreo Chocolate Cheesecake,"
Ingredients

2 cans of full-fat coconut milk (chilled overnight)
1 tub of Tofutti plain vegan cream cheese
7oz (200g
1 cup) vegan dark chocolate
5oz (150g
1.5 cup) Oreos
3tbsp vegan margarine
4tbsp powdered sugar

","
Method
1) Start by crushing 150g of Oreo biscuits. The easiest way to do this is by blitzing in a food processor but if you don’t have one feel free to pop them into a sandwich bag, cover with a cloth and smash them with a rolling pin.
2) Melt the 3tbsp of vegan margarine and add this to the crushed biscuits.
3) Press the biscuit mixture into your pan until the bottom is evenly coated and then pop this into the fridge.
4) Take the can of chilled coconut milk from the fridge, carefully open it and scoop out the hard coconut fat from the top. Be careful not to get any of the watery section as this will make it more difficult for the cheesecake to set. Add to this the tub of vegan cream cheese and powdered sugar. Blitz it all together until smooth (1-2mins).
5) Melt 150g of the chocolate, add this to the coconut/cream cheese mixture and combine.
6) After that you have a smooth, chocolate mixture, take your Oreo biscuit base out of the fridge. Dollop the coconut/cream cheese mixture on top and smooth it off.
7) Here is where a little patience is required; leave the cheesecake to chill for 2 hours although it works best if you leave it overnight (I know I couldn’t the first time so I totally wouldn’t blame you if you had 2 hours ready to count down on your stopwatch)!
8) Once chilled, take the remaining 50g of chocolate, chop it finely and use it to top the cheesecake to add texture and even more chocolatey goodness to your cheesecake.

1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon brown rice syrup
½ tablespoon balsamic vinegar
pinch of sea salt
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

","
Preparation
Serves 4.

Method

To make the tofu feta, put the nutritional yeast flakes into a bowl with the lemon juice and zest and leave to dissolve.


Heat the oil in a small frying pan on a medium heat and add the tofu and garlic. Pan-fry until slightly golden, then add the lemon mix, salt and pepper, bring to the boil and cook until the lemon juice has evaporated. Spoon into a bowl and allow to cool. Check that it’s just a little too salty, like feta.


To make the dressing, whisk together the lemon juice, syrup, vinegar, salt and extra virgin olive oil in a small bowl.


Mix the rocket and basil leaves together in a bowl. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the dressing over the leaves and toss together. Keep the rest of the dressing for further dipping and drizzling.


Warm a griddle pan on a high heat and brush with a little oil. Just as the oil begins to smoke, place your figs widthways in the pan. Allow to cook for 2 minutes, basting them with balsamic vinegar as you go.Turn them when well caramelized, then remove the now sticky figs from the heat.


Scatter the leaves beautifully on plates, and top with the warm figs, a couple of spoons of the tofu feta and a sprinkling of toasted pine nuts.

Burgers
•	½ Tb. Ground Flaxseed
•	1 ½ Tb. Water
•	1 1/3 cup Cooked Sweet Potato
•	1 cup Canned Garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed
•	2 Tb. Dry Quick Oats
•	2 T. + 1/3 c. (divided) Bread Crumbs – regular, panko, whole wheat or gluten-free all work!
•	1-2 T. Finely Chopped White or Yellow Onion
•	3/4 tsp. of EACH Cinnamon, Chili Powder, Garlic Powder, and Salt
Maple Dijon Sauce
•	1/3 c. Maple Syrup
•	1/3 c. Dijon Mustard

","
Preparation
This sweet take on veggie burgers is sure to impress your family and friends. Makes 4 Burgers or 8 mini Patties!

First, roast two large or three medium sized sweet potatoes (poked several times with a fork) in a 375 degree oven for about 45 – 60 minutes. They’ll be very soft and fork tender when they’re done. You may not need to use ALL of the cooked sweet potato.
Next, combine the water and ground flaxseed in a small bowl and then set it aside for now.
In a medium-sized bowl, place your garbanzo beans and mash them up with a potato masher or large fork, leaving some beans partially intact.
To the same bowl, add your cooked sweet potato, dry oats, 2 tablespoons of breadcrumbs, onion, spices and salt. Finally, add the flaxseed/water mixture and then stir it all together.
Form this mixture into four equal-sized patties. Then, coat each side with breadcrumbs and put them in a lightly oiled pan over medium-high heat.
While those patties are cooking, prep your Maple Dijon Sauce by combining the maple syrup and mustard in a small bowl.
After approximately 5 – 7 minutes, flip the burgers.
While you’re waiting for the second side to cook, prep your other toppings. I like to use lettuce, tomato and sometimes a bit of sliced avocado!
Once those burgers form a nice crispy brown surface on each side, remove them from the pan and sprinkle them with a small pinch of salt and pepper.
If you’re like me and love a toasted bun, now would be the time to place those buns in the hot pan to lightly toast on each side.
The last step? Place those burgers on your buns, drizzle with plenty of Maple Dijon Sauce, load up your toppings, and enjoy!
This recipe can also be used to make a killer appetizer or side dish! Just form the mixture into small cakes instead of patties.

3 Tbsp tamari or shoyu (organic soya sauce)		
1 Tbsp white miso paste dissolved in two tbsp water		
1 Tbsp freshly squeezed ginger juice				
1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar						
2 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds		

","
Preparation
To get the best taste from tofu I dry-fry it and then marinate it for a few hours, or overnight in the fridge.
To dry-fry simply press excess water out with paper-towel, slice the tofu and place in a dry-frying pan at a low heat and press with a spatula.  You will hear a hissing sound as the excess water is removed.  Turnover and do the other side. To marinade I use 1 Tbsp of each – freshly squeezed ginger juice, shoyu and mirin – you can add ¼ tsp turmeric, sweet paprika, garlic powder or whatever taste excites you.

Method
Press the tofu in paper towels to absorb any excess water.
Whisk the soya sauce, miso paste, ginger juice and vinegar in a cup and set aside.

Heat the toasted sesame oil in a wok over medium heat and add the garlic, onion and the mushrooms stir well and cook for 5 minutes.
Add the diced tofu and cook on a high heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the kale stir and cover for 5 minutes or until it turns bright green adding a little water if necessary.
Add the broccoli cover for 3 or 4 minutes, if the pan seems dry add a splash more water.
Remove from the heat. Stir in the dressing.

5 inch piece of Kombu (seaweed) [13cm]
2 dried shitake or maitake mushrooms 
6 inch piece of wakame (seaweed) [15cm]
1 onion finely diced
1 carrot finely diced
1 celery stick finely diced
Spring or filtered water 
1 tsp miso per cup of soup
Fresh grated ginger juice (1Tbsp) added at the end of cooking
Spring onions finely diced for garnish

","
Method

Soak the Kombu and dried mushrooms in 6 cups of filtered water for 30 minutes.
Remove the mushrooms, dice them (discarding the stem as it can be bitter tasting) and place back in the pot.
Bring the stock to a boil then lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes (This stock is called DASHI in Japan and is the base for many noodle dishes, stews, sauces as well as soups.)
Soak the wakame for 10 minutes and then cut into small pieces with kitchen scissors.
Add the wakame and the soaking water to the pot, along with the vegetables and simmer for 20 minutes.
Whisk miso with a little of the broth and then add to the soup and switch off the heat.
Do not allow the miso to boil or it will destroy the enzymes.
Serve hot with finely chopped spring onions to garnish.  You can add cubed tofu or soba noodles to make the soup more of a meal.

Variations: You may add some diced garlic or ginger juice (squeezed from grated ginger) to your miso soup for a different taste. Add any leftover cooked grains such as millet, short grain brown rice or quinoa to your soup and make it more of a lunch or meal. You can place a small piece of lemon in the bottom of each bowl and then pour in the soup.  This aids in liver cleansing and adds vitamin C.

Ingredients
1 bunch of carrots with leaves (either multi coloured or traditionally orange)
200g salt
300g plain flour (gluten free is fine)
2 tbsp. finely chopped rosemary
2 tbsp. vegetable oil
150 ml warm water
A small tub of coconut yoghurt
30g smoked almonds
1 tablespoon vegetable extra virgin olive oil
1 jar Belazu Verbena Harissa Paste
Washed leaves from the carrots
Edible herbs or flowers like basil, nasturtium, tarragon, or borage
","
Preparation

Trim the leafy tops from the carrots and then make the crust. Mix the salt and flour together in a bowl, add the rosemary and oil and stir in the water. Knead by hand or in a standing mixer for a couple of minutes to obtain smooth dough. Let it rest for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 160C
Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1cm. Cut rectangles large enough to wrap the dough individually around each vegetable and press the edges together to seal.
Put the dough-wrapped carrots on an oven tray lined with baking paper and bake for 45 minutes until the dough is hard and the veg inside are tender (test with a skewer).
Once the carrots are cooked, slice open the salt crust and leave until cool enough to handle. Discard the crust and use a cloth to rub the skin from the carrots.
For the bases, take one cooked carrot and slice it lengthways into 4 strips about 1/2cm thick, saving any offcuts. Lay each strip slightly off centre of 4 serving plates.
Take the offcuts and the just one of the carrots and blend to a smooth pesto in a food processor with a big teaspoon of coconut yoghurt, the smoked almonds and the olive oil. Add a spoonful of water if the mixture is too thick. Place in a piping bag. Pipe a line of carrot pesto along each carrot strip on the plates.
Slice the remaining carrots into accurate discs 1 cm thick plus a few thinner ones. Stand the discs in descending size order along the strips in the shape of a carrot.
Spoon a little yoghurt and harissa alongside for dipping and finish the plate with the herbs or flowers that you have found or foraged.

Preparation
You will need:
An oven proof dish approx 21 x 15cm (6cm deep) or 8½ x 6 inches (2½in deep).

Method

Place the cashews into a mug or jug along with the juiced lemon, salt, pepper and parsley.
Allow the cashews to soak in the lemon juice for up to an hour and then blend with a blender to create a thick creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick then add a dash of water to achieve your desired sauce-like consistency.
Roughly chop red onion and mushrooms.
Crush or finely chop garlic and saute in a medium sized pan with onion and mushrooms (with a splash of olive oil) for a couple of minutes to bring out their flavour.
Add the lentils and water to the pan and bring to the boil.
In the meantime add allspice, cinnamon, cardamon, sea salt, coconut sugar and passata to the pan, stirring to mix everything together.
Once the pan has come to the boil turn down to a low/medium heat, placing the lid on. Stir regularly over a period of about 45 minutes or until all water has absorbed and the mixture resembles a thick sauce. If you are busy and want to come back to this later, then simply cook for about 30 minutes, turn off and leave it to finish cooking with the lid on, in its own heat.
Whilst the lentil part is cooking in the pan, cook the pasta, drain it and put to the side.
Slice apple into thin slices and roughly chop parsley. When the lentil part has cooked, add the parsley to the pan and mix in.
Spoon about half of this lentil mixture into an oven proof dish and add a layer of your cooked rice pasta (this should be about ½ of your pasta). Make up another layer on top of the pasta with your apple slices.
Spoon the rest of your lentil mixture on top of your apple layer and then add another layer with the rest of the pasta.
Spoon/pour on your cashew sauce on top of the final layer of pasta. If the cashew sauce seems too thick, then add a little water to loosen it up.
Your layers might resemble something like this:
(base) lentil – pasta – apple – lentil – pasta – cashew sauce (topping)
But remember there is no right or wrong. If your creativity is inspired, then let it flow!
Place your whole dish in the oven at gas mark 6 (200˚C/400˚F) for approximately 40 minutes and then serve hot with veggies or salad.

Ingredients

300g sweet potato, peeled weight
300g gluten free plain flour
2 tsp baking powder
½ tsp sea salt flakes
65ml water
3 tbsp olive oil

","
Preparation
If you make the pureed sweet potato in advance then it will take hardly anytime at all to bake.
Makes 1 loaf and Serves 8

Method
Preheat the oven to 200c and lightly grease a baking tray.
Peel the sweet potato and cut into 2cm chunks.  Bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil, add in the sweet potato and boil gently for 10 minutes or until the sweet potato is very tender to a knife point – you want them almost on the point of collapse as this will help when pureeing them.  Remove from the heat and drain, place in a food processor and blitz until completely smooth.
Place the flour, baking powder and salt into a large mixing bowl and whisk together until combined.  Add the sweet potato puree, water and olive oil and mix together until combined and pulling into a ball of dough.  Use your hands to pull the dough together and knead very lightly for a minute or two just to smooth out the dough and help bring it together.
Shape the dough into a circle around 6 inches in diameter, smoothing the edges and the top with your hands.  Place on the baking sheet and then use a sharp knife to cut two crosses into the top of the loaf, about ½ cm deep, so that the loaf is already marked into 8 wedges before it goes into the oven.
Bake in the oven for 35 – 40 minutes until golden and crisp.  Serve while warm.

50g (½ cup or 1¾ oz approx) quinoa
200ml (¾ cup or 7fl oz approx) coconut milk
50ml (about a ¼ cup or 1¾ fl oz) water
5 pitted dates
Sprinkle of cinnamon (optional)
Fresh berries (optional)

Preparation

Rinse quinoa thoroughly a using an extra fine sieve. This removes any of the natural soapy, saponins that sometimes coat quinoa.
Chop dates into small pieces and then add all ingredients to a pan (leaving out the cinnamon or berries, which will be added once served).
Bring pan to the boil and simmer on a low heat for 25 minutes (or until the quinoa has absorbed all of the liquid). Stir once in a while with a wooden spoon. The dates should slowly fall apart melting into the pan to create a delicious sweetness. If the dates are particularly tough, then encourage the breaking down process by pressing them down with your spoon.
Once cooked enjoy your quinoa bowl served hot or cold, adding a sprinkle of cinnamon and/or a small handful of fresh berries.

2 tbsp mirin 
2 tsp toasted sesame oil
3½ tbsp rice vinegar
1 shallot (green onion), finely chopped
½ bunch of fresh chives, finely chopped
1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped

1 garlic clove, crushed
15g/½oz fresh root ginger, peeled and finely chopped
1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped
2 carrots, grated
1 bunch of spring onions (scallions), finely chopped
3 wood ear mushrooms (or any mushroom of your choice), finely sliced
350g/12oz fresh firm tofu
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
400g/12oz pack dumpling skins 

","
Method

To make the sauce, combine all the ingredients in a bowl and set aside.
For the dumpling filling, heat 1 tbsp of the vegetable oil in a pan, then add the onion, garlic, ginger and chilli and sauté for about 4 minutes until cooked through. Add the carrot, spring onions and mushrooms, then crumble the tofu into the pan. Cook the mixture for 10–15 minutes until it’s quite dry, then season with the soy sauce and toasted sesame oil. Leave until cool enough to handle.
Take a dumpling skin in one hand, then dip the index finger of your other hand in a little water and use it to wet the top half of the skin. Put about ½ tbsp of the filling mixture into the middle of the skin, then fold the skin over to form a half-moon shape, crimping and sticking the edges together as you go. Repeat with the remaining skins and filling.
In a large frying pan with a lid, heat the remaining vegetable oil over a high heat. Add the dumplings to the pan and fry, uncovered, for about 4 minutes until the bottoms are golden and crisp.
Add a ladleful of water and quickly put the lid on the frying pan to steam the dumplings for 2 minutes. Remove the lid and continue to fry, uncovered, until any leftover water has evaporated – be careful as the hot liquid can splash. Keep an eye on the bottom of the dumplings at this stage as you don’t want them to burn. Gently lift the dumplings with a spatula and transfer them to a serving plate and serve immediately with the dipping sauce.

1 cup cooked brown rice
1 cup frozen corn kernels
1 green bell pepper, diced
1 jalapeno pepper, finely diced
1 tablespoon grapeseed or olive oil
3 tablespoons mild or medium salsa
1 teaspoon garlic powder

1/2 teaspoon chipotle chili powder
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/3 cup brown rice flour
For bitty buns:
1 1/2 cups water, warmed to between 110-120 degrees F
2 teaspoons agave nectar
4 teaspoons active dry yeast
3 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons vital wheat gluten

","
Preparation
Homemade veggie burgers can be a challenge to some! Vegetable patties can be cooked by baking, frying, or grilling. For this recipe, I formed the patties the night before and then froze them in order to make them grillable. This actually worked really well. Note, however, that I grilled them in a grill pan, not on an outdoor grill. Your results may vary.

Method

To make the patties, combine one half of the beans and one half of the rice in a food processor. Add the oil and salsa and process until mostly smooth. Combine with the remaining ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Form into 8 patties with your hands. I roughly measured them as 1/3 cup of patty mix each. Wrap in waxed paper or parchment paper and let freeze in a container or on a flat surface in a plastic bag.
To make the bitty burger buns, combine the warm water, agave, and yeast and whisk until combined, just a few seconds. Let stand 10 minutes until proofed. Combine with the remaining ingredients and mix until dough forms. Knead until smooth. Add more flour if too sticky. I added an additional two tablespoons. I also used my standing mixer for this, using the dough hook of course. I let the machine knead the dough for 3-4 minutes. If kneading by hand you may be looking at 5-7 minutes instead. Roll to a 1/2 inch thickness, then cut with a biscuit cutter into 12-16 rounds.
Sprinkle cornmeal on a couple of cookie sheets. Place the buns on the cookie sheets. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place for one hour. Bake at 375 degrees for 10-12 minutes, until browned on top.
When ready for the burgers, lightly oil a non-stick grill pan. Preheat over medium high heat. Cook each patty for 5-7 minutes, pushing down with a spatula occasionally for nice grill marks. Gently flip and cook for the same amount of time on the other side.
You don’t have to make all of the patties at once. Just keep them in the refrigerator until you’re ready for another!
Garnish with lettuce, tomato, onion, avocado, pickles, you name it.
Makes 8 patties, 12-16 buns.

Ingredients

1 pack 20 inch rice wrappers
1 cucumber
1 large avocado
8 French radishes
75g watercress
1 bunch dill, washed
Salt and pepper to season

Dipping sauce:

1 large orange, juiced
25ml soy sauce

","
Method

To make the dipping sauce place the orange juice in a pan on a low heat for 7-8 minutes so it reduces by around two thirds. Take of the heat and mix with the soy sauce. Place in a small bowl and set aside to cool.
Take the cucumber and slice into thin strips using a julienne peeler or sharp knife. Only cut the outer flesh of the cucumber discarding the more watery core.
Halve and peel the avocado, remove the stone and slice lengthways in half inch slices. Slice the radishes lengthways.
Fill a bowl with slightly warm water. The diameter of the bowl needs to be wider than the rice paper so that the rice paper can be fully immersed in the water.
Dunk one rice paper in the bowl of water for 5 seconds. Give it a shake to get rid of excess water and lay on a clean chopping board.
Near one of the edges of the paper place a handful or two of the watercress tearing any larger clumps into smaller sections as the rolls are meant to be eaten by hand.
Next, place two or three slices of the avocado on top of the watercress. Then, take a few sprigs of dill and, using a pair of scissors, chop finely over the avocado and watercress and season with salt and pepper.
Fold the near edge the wrapper over the contents, then fold both sides into the middle and roll up.
Serve with the dipping sauce.

95g soft brown sugar
2tsp cardamom, ground
250g wholemeal plain flour
125g porridge oats
1 x 340g jar vegan mincemeat (one from Meridian is widely available)

Method

Preheat the oven to 180C.
Line an 11×7″ flapjack tin with baking parchment and set aside.
Place the margarine, sugar and cardamom in a small non-stick pan over a low heat, until the margarine has melted and the sugar has dissolved.
Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl combine the flour and oats.
When the margarine mixture is ready pour into the flour and oats and mix well. The mixture will look like rough bread crumbs rather than a dough so don’t panic if it feel a little dry.
Spoon half the mix into the prepared tin and press down well to form the base of the slice. Next spread the mincemeat over in an even layer. Sprinkle over the remaining flour mixture and place into the oven.
Bake for 20-25 minutes until the top is lightly golden. Remove from the oven and cool.
Cut into pieces and enjoy. Best served with a spoon of vanilla soya yogurt and a cup of Earl Grey.

Quick dull health and safety note: The mincemeat achieves a temperature close to lava so don’t give in to temptation and try and sample too soon!! Let it cool for a good ten minutes at least.

Ingredients

Black Rice
1 x can of refried beans
Guacamole:
2 ripe avocados
Red onion (about half a small one)
Stalk of spring onion 
1 x red chilli 
 6-8 cherry tomatoes 
Juice of about half a lemon
Salt and cracked pepper
Chilli Non Carne (recipe link in Instructions)

","
Method
What’s on the plate?
Black Rice – I’ve been obsessed with this ever since I was introduced to it by Jane, and I love the fact that it has bite and is really easy to cook. 1 part rice to 2 parts water, bring to boil, turn down and simmer for 40 minutes. Works perfectly every time. I buy the Biona black rice, but you should be able to find it in most supermarkets.
Refried Beans – I’ve been a refried bean fan ever since I was a kid. Great in nachos as well, but lovely here because of their creamy flavour. You buy it in cans, and you’ll find them in the Mexican section.
Guacamole – I always make my own, as it is so much tastier, really easy and doesn’t have any sour cream sneaked in (many store-made guacs do, so always check the label before you buy). My ‘go-to’ recipe is this:

Mash up 2 ripe avocados with a fork
Finely dice some red onion (about half a small one) and a stalk of spring onion – add to bowl
Finely dice one red chilli (up to you if you keep the seeds or not!) – add to bowl
Chop up about 6-8 cherry tomatoes into little pieces (in half and then in half again at least) – add to bowl
Squeeze in the juice of about half a lemon – do this to taste. You can always add more lemon, so start off with a little first
Salt and cracked pepper

If you don’t have any fresh chilli then you can use a hot sauce, like Tabasco, instead. And if you’re not keen on heat, then just leave the chilli out altogether.

2tbsp psyllium husk
1tbsp sunflower oil
","
Method
Heat your oven to 190c/375f/GM5.
Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Once the oil is hot add the onion and carrot. Fry for 10-15 minutes until the onion is translucent.

Ingredients
1 tsp coconut oil
1 medium onion
3 garlic cloves
1/4 thumb ginger
100g cherry tomatoes
1/2 small butternut squash
2 medium potatoes
Large handful of coriander
100g frozen peas
80g baby spinach leaves
1 pot of Tideford Organics Vegan Rogan Josh (or similar)
1/2 lime
Salt and pepper
2 x 320g sheets of gluten-free puff pastry
4 tsp gluten-free plain flour, plus extra for dusting
1 tbsp plant milk of your choice
 
","
Preparation
4 springform pie tins approx. 11cm in diameter

Method

Heat the coconut oil in a large pan on a medium heat. While the pan heats up, peel and discard the skin of the onion, slice it thinly and add it to the pan. Fry for 10 minutes, stirring frequently until it begins to caramelise.
Meanwhile, peel and finely dice the ginger and garlic. Then peel and dice the butternut squash and potatoes. Quarter the cherry tomatoes and finely chop the stalks of the coriander, saving the leaves for later. Add the ginger, garlic, squash, potatoes, tomatoes and coriander stalks to the pan and fry for a further 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add the frozen peas, spinach leaves and Rogan Josh Curry Sauce to the frying pan and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Next, roughly chop the coriander leaves and stir them into the pan along with the juice from the half of lime and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Preheat the oven to 200°C fan.
Meanwhile, roll out the pastry on a floured surface until it’s a few millimetres thick. Use a sharp knife to cut 4 circles a few cms wider than the pie tins (make sure you leave enough pastry for the tops), then line the pie tins with the pastry by pressing the pastry into the base and sides to ensure the inside of the tin is fully covered.
Sprinkle a tsp of flour over the base to stop it from going soggy, then fill each pie with the curry filling.
Use the remaining pastry to cover each pie and pinch the top and sides of the pastry together to close the pie.
Brush the tops with plant milk and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown.
Serve with chips and mushy peas. Enjoy!

Jus-Roll frozen puff pastry (or similar) – ready rolled or blocks
One large white onion, sliced
A few cloves of garlic (more or less depending on how garlicky you like your food), chopped
Dried parsley, salt, pepper and any other of your favourite herbs.
5 – 6 large field mushrooms or around 10 smaller variety mushrooms. Chestnut mushrooms are lovely as they have a nice nutty flavour. Slice thickly
A pack of Fry’s thick-cut chunky strips (or other beef substitute)
Bisto original gravy granules or other vegan granules
A cup of Vegan ale – Check Barnivore, a great vegan alcohol website. If you don’t drink alcohol, replace with water.

","
Method

Fry the onion and garlic, herbs and seasoning in some oil until a little soft.
Add the mushrooms and “meat” strips and fry until the strips start to look browned
Add the ale and sprinkle in the gravy granules, a tablespoon at a time until it starts to thicken. Make sure the gravy isn’t watery, as it will make the pastry really soggy. It just needs to cover the ingredients in the pan.
Roll out the pastry, line a roasting dish with it and place the pie filling in the dish. Place the pastry on the top and squash the edges of the bottom layer and the top of the pie together with a fork. If you want less pastry, you can leave off the bottom layer and just have the top. Don’t worry if it looks a mess, when the pastry puffs up, it will look fab! And if the gravy overflows and runs out, even better!
Cook at 200 degrees for about half an hour, or until the pastry looks nice and brown.

1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
1 x pomegranate dressing

For the garnish:

4 tablespoons pomegranate seeds
a handful of chopped fresh parsley and mint

","
Method

Put the lentils into a pan and cover with water. Leave for 5 minutes, then pick out any floating lentils. Drain, cover with fresh water, and add the bay leaf. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring and checking the water level (add more if needed). The lentils should be springy, but cooked. Drain if necessary, though there should be very little liquid left.


Put the bulgur wheat into a large bowl and pour over the boiling water or stock, enough to cover it by about 2cm. Tightly cover and leave for 30 minutes. Once cooked, fluff with a fork and cool.


In a frying pan, heat the oil on a high heat, then add the cauliflower and begin to fry. Stir regularly and cook for 10–12 minutes. Once the cauliflower has softened and the edges are slightly charred, sprinkle over the ground spices and salt and cook for a further 2 minutes, stirring well. Cover and leave to cool. The cauliflower should be nicely coated with the spices. Make the pomegranate.


Dressing. Add three-quarters of the lentils to the bulgur wheat, along with the cauliflower, herbs and the rest of the ingredients, then pour over the dressing and mix gently together with your hands until well combined.
Place in a wide, shallow serving bowl and spread out evenly. Sprinkle over the remaining lentils and garnish with pomegranate seeds and herbs.

Chocolate sponge:
1 1/4 cups flour
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
1 cup warm water
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 tsp distilled white or apple cider vinegar
Cherry filling:
3/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoons cornstarch
1 dash salt
1/3 cup cherry liqueur or water if you do not want to include alcohol
Two tins of cherries, drained
Cream filling:
Non-dairy whipping cream (Soyatoo whipping cream is available from US or UK online stores)

","
Method
Chocolate sponge:

Mix all the dry ingredients together well, add in the wet ingredients and mix well.
Divide the mixture between the two 8 inch round baking tins.
If you want a towering cake, double the sponge mixture recipe and divide between three baking tins.
Cook for 25 – 30 mins at 200/400 degrees or gas mark 6 and check by poking the cakes with a small knife or toothpick. If the knife or toothpick doesn’t come out clean, put back in the oven for 5 mins at a time until the poke test comes out clean.
Leave the sponges to cool when done.

Cherry filling:

Heat the sugar, cornstarch and salt in a pan.
Stir in the cherry liqueur or water.
Then add the cherries and cook until the mixture thickens. It can be a little runny as the juice can soak into the bottom sponge.
You can save the drained cherry juice and add some cherry liqueur to make some lovely sweet shots to go with the cake!

Cream filling:
Soyatoo whipping cream is available from US or UK online stores.

Just keep whipping these until they are as thick as you can get – using an electric whisk is best, otherwise you might be whisking all day!

To assemble!

Place the cherry filling over the first sponge and let the juice soak in.
If you have only one more sponge, place the cream on top of the cherries. If you have two more, place the next sponge on top of the cherries and then layer the cream on top of that.
Place the last layer of sponge on the cream.
On the top, you can go crazy with all cream, or cream around the edge of the top sponge and some cherries in the middle.
Garnish with your choice of glacé cherries, chocolate shavings or maybe chocolate chips!

463,https://veganuary.com/recipes/tofu-scramble-breakfast-burritos/,Tofu Scramble Breakfast Burritos,"
Ingredients

1 x block of firm tofu
Olive or rapeseed oil
1 x onion
2/3 garlic cloves
1/2 teaspoon of thyme
A good shake of paprika
1/4 – 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric
1/2 tablespoons soy/tamari sauce
Optional: mushrooms, peppers, chili, red and yellow pepper etc.
2-3 tablespoons of nutritional yeast
Black pepper and salt to taste
Tortilla wraps
Garnish options:
Tomato salsa
Hot sauce
Jalapenos
Spring onions
Grated vegan cheese
Avocados

","
Preparation
This recipe uses a whole block of tofu so makes a healthy serving of scramble. How many burritos you have will be determined by how much you pack into each, and how large your tortilla wraps are… But you should have four large burritos if you make them according to the recipe below.

Method

Rinse the tofu, wrap it in a clean tea towel, then put something heavy on top (some books, perhaps) to press the liquid from it.
Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic. Add these to a frying pan with a splash of olive oil.
Cook for a bit and then add the thyme,  paprika and turmeric. Mix and then add the soy sauce.
Add any other veg you want to include and stir.
Now, take the books off the tofu and give the tea towel another squeeze. Then with your hands, crumble the tofu into the frying pan.
Mix the tofu through, using your spoon to break up any bigger bits. It should look similar to scrambled egg now.
Once all mixed in, add nutritional yeast and mix in. I am obsessed with nutritional yeast so I always add more than 2!
Add some pepper and mix again.
Leave to cook for another 20 mins or so, turning down the heat a little to stop it sticking. Give it a stir occasionally.
After about 20 minutes you can start to prep your tortilla wraps. Spread some tomato salsa in the middle of the wrap. Add sliced avocado or a little homemade guacamole on top, and then sprinkle on some grated vegan cheese. Then pile some scramble on top of the cheese and add sliced spring onions and jalapenos on top.
Wrap up and serve with extra avocado and Frank’s hot sauce.

464,https://veganuary.com/recipes/chocolate-and-peanut-butter-freakshake/,Chocolate and Peanut Butter ‘Freakshake’,"
Ingredients

150g (2/3 cup) nut milk (hazelnut or almond work really well here)
1 banana
1 heaped tbsp peanut butter
1 scoop dairy-free vanilla ice cream
1 tsp cocoa powder
1 tbsp maple syrup
100g (3.5 oz) plain/dark chocolate chips CHECK THE LABEL
Handful sweet popcorn

","
Preparation
 
 

Method

Place the nut milk, banana, peanut butter, ice cream, cocoa powder, maple syrup and about a third of the chocolate chips into a blender or food processor, and blitz until smooth and creamy, (this may take up to a minute).
Set aside about a tablespoon full of the remaining chocolate chips, and pour the rest into a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on full power for one minute until melted, and whisk with a fork until smooth.
Dip the rim of your glass into the melted chocolate, then use a teaspoon to drizzle more of the chocolate around the rim to create the trademark Freakshake dribbles around the outside.
Pour in the milkshake, then top with as much popcorn as gravity will allow, scatter carefully with the chocolate chips, and then drizzle the whole lot with even more melted chocolate.

Ingredients

1 tin chickpeas
3 sprigs rosemary
1 tsp sumac
1 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp chilli flakes
2 tsp oil (coconut or rice bran)

","
Preparation
Heat the oven to 180°C / 350°F / Gas Mark 4.

Method

Drain and rinse the chickpeas and set about peeling them (I think it’s worth it, for extra crunch). Shaking them in a colander or rolling between sheets of kitchen paper seems to help loosen the skins.
Either place all of the ingredients in a bowl and mix them together until the chickpeas are nicely coated, or make a little bag with parchment paper to shake it all together (making sure you’ve gathered all the edges together!). My preferred method is to use the parchment paper, as it means you’re not left with an oily bowl to wash up.
Spread the chickpeas out on a sheet of parchment paper on a baking tray. I use the same sheet of paper from step 3. 5. Cook for 20 minutes, give them a little shake, then cook for a further 20 minutes.

476,https://veganuary.com/recipes/adzuki-bean-soup-with-squash-and-parsnip/,Adzuki Bean Soup with Squash and Parsnip,"
Ingredients

6 cups filtered water
1 cup adzuki beans soaked overnight night (or used canned organic beans)
2 stamp size pieces kombu seaweed
1 cup diced onion
1 cup diced carrot
1 cup diced squash
1 cup diced parsnip
Freshly grated ginger juice to taste (approximately 1 tbsp)
Shoyu/soy sauce to taste

","
Method
Discard the water from the soaking beans and add fresh filtered water. Bring water with adzuki beans and kombu to a boil over medium-high heat.
Reduce heat to medium and cook for 30-45 minutes until beans are soft.
(Discard this part of the recipe if you are using canned beans – see below.)
Add the onion and carrot and cook for a further 10 minutes. Add the squash and parsnip and cook for 15 minutes more or until soft. Stir in the ginger juice and add shoyu to taste.
If using canned beans: Place the cooked beans along with the onion and carrot and cook for 10 minutes in 2 cups of water. Add the squash, parsnip and 1 cup of water and cook for a further 10 minutes. Season the soup to taste with ginger juice and shoyu and serve with some crusty sourdough bread.

According to a recent study, regular bean eaters are 22 percent less likely to be overweight and have smaller waistlines than those who don’t eat them. Beans release energy slowly into the body, making them a great weight loss food. They are also high in protein and fibre, which satiates the appetite and helps keep you full for longer periods of time.

Ingredients

1 and 1/2 cups cashews
1 roasted red pepper from a jar (or roast your own if you have time)
3/4 cup cold water
1 tbsp lemon juice or apple cider vinegar
1/2 red onion
1 garlic clove
1/2 tbsp olive or coconut oil
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp turmeric
Black pepper to taste

","
Preparation
Makes 1 large jar
Equipment

Food processor
Frying pan
Wooden spoon
Bowl and water for soaking the cashews
Measuring cups
Chopping board and knife


Method
Put the cashews into a bowl, cover with cold water and allow to soak for 30 mins. Remove the pepper from the jar so it’s ready to use, or roast a fresh pepper if you prefer.
Roughly chop the onion and garlic and fry gently for 5-10 mins in the oil, so they soften and turn golden. Add the turmeric and paprika after a couple of minutes of cooking.
* Time Saving Tip *
You can add the onion and garlic raw if you prefer, but I found that my loved ones weren’t shy about telling me how strongly it smelled!
Drain the cashews and add to the processor with the cooked onions, garlic, roasted pepper, water and lemon juice or vinegar. Blitz together on high-speed, stopping every so often to scrape down the sides. Keep blending until a smooth texture has formed and then get a (big) tasting spoon to try it. Add black pepper and (if needed) salt, and give it another quick whizz.
* Serving Suggestion *
You’re now ready to enjoy this creamy goodness on crackers or open sandwiches. It’s also perfect for mixing through cooked pasta and veggies, serves as a great dip alternative to hummus, plus any other tasty combinations you discover! Store in an airtight jar, and it will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.

Ingredients

For the cake:
2 tbsp flaxseed meal
3/4 cup non-dairy milk
1 1/3 cups whole wheat, spelt, or mixed gluten-free
2 tsp baking powder
1 tbsp matcha green tea powder
1 tsp lemon zest
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/8 tsp salt
1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
1/2 cup coconut sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup raw almonds, toasted and chopped
For the glaze:
1 can light coconut milk, placed in the refrigerator overnight and unshaken
1 tbsp arrowroot powder
1 tbsp maple syrup or agave nectar
1/2 tsp vanilla extract

","
Method
Preheat the oven to 425°F. Oil an 8×4-inch loaf pan.
In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flaxseed meal and non-dairy milk. Set aside.
In another medium-sized bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, matcha, lemon zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.
In a larger bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, coconut sugar, and vanilla extract. Whisk in the flax mixture. Add a third of the dry mixture at a time to the wet mixture, stirring well to combine after each addition. After all the dry ingredients are incorporated, stir in the almonds.
Scoop the batter into the oiled loaf pan, place in the oven, and immediately lower the oven temperature to 375°F. Bake for 20-30 minutes, or until a toothpick or knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool in the pan for at least 20 minutes before placing on a cooling rack to cool completely.
While the cake bakes, prepare the glaze. Carefully pour only the creamy white liquid at the top of the can of coconut milk into a medium-sized bowl, taking care to get as little as possible of the clear coconut water at the bottom of the can into the bowl. Reserve the leftover coconut water for smoothies. Whisk in the arrowroot, syrup/nectar, and vanilla. Place the glaze in the refrigerator until the cake has cooled completely.
Once the cake has cooled completely, place it onto a baking sheet and spoon the coconut glaze over the top, letting the glaze drizzle down the sides of the cake. Transfer the cake to a serving plate and either serve immediately, or, for a moister texture, allow the cake to sit for a couple of hours while the glaze soaks in.

Measure all of the cake ingredients into a large bowl and beat well for 1 minute until thoroughly combined.  Turn into the prepared tin and level the surface.


Bake for about 1¾ – 2 hours or until skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean and the cake is shrinking from sides of the tin.  Cover the cake with foil after 1 hour if it is beginning to brown too much.  Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes then turn out, peel off the parchment and finish cooling on a wire rack.


Decorate as you wish.  I like to melt a little apricot jam, brush on cake and decorate the top with nuts and dried fruits, placing marzipan festive shapes around the cake.

Ingredients

Olive oil
6 big portobello mushrooms, roughly chopped into little bits
A few sprigs of fresh thyme, leaves picked
Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 × 400g tin of white beans, haricot or cannellini, well drained
4 fat medjool dates, pitted
2 cloves of garlic, peeled and finely chopped
A small bunch of fresh parsley, finely chopped
2 tablespoons tahini
2 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari
200g cooked and cooled brown rice
(100g raw weight)
50g breadcrumbs or oats
Grated zest of 1 unwaxed lemon
To serve:
1–2 avocados, peeled and sliced
Tomato relish or ketchup
Pickled cucumber (see above)
A few handfuls of spinach leaves
8 seeded burger buns (I use wholemeal ones)

","
Preparation
I’ve played around with a lot of recipes before settling on this one, some full of bright herb freshness and grated veg, some packed with protein-rich tofu, and all were good, but what I look for in a burger is a deep moreish favour, savoury and complex, so this is the one.
I use brown rice here, but any cooked grain you have will do – quinoa, pearl barley and farro all work well.
I like to make a quick pickled cucumber to top these with. Thinly slice a quarter of a cucumber and pop it into a bowl with a pinch of salt, a squeeze of agave syrup, and a good tablespoon of white wine vinegar, then scrunch together and leave to sit while you make your burgers. A homemade quick pickle that beats a gherkin any day. 🙂

Method
Get a large pan on a medium heat and add a splash of olive oil. Once the pan is good and hot, add the mushrooms and thyme and season with salt and pepper. Fry on a good heat until the mushrooms have dried out and are slightly browned, then set to one side and leave to cool.
Next, drain the white beans and put them into a food processor with the dates, garlic, parsley, tahini and soy sauce. Pulse until you have a smoothish mixture, then transfer to a bowl and add the rice, breadcrumbs, lemon zest and the cooled mushrooms. Mix well, then put into the fridge for 10 minutes or so to firm up.
Once cooled, divide the mixture into 8 portions and shape into 8 patties.  Place them on a baking tray lined with baking paper and pop into the fridge until needed. (This can be done the day before – and the burgers freeze well at this point.)
Preheat your oven to 230°C/fan 210°C/gas 8 and bake the burgers for 15 minutes, until nicely brown. If you like cheese on your burger, pop a slice on top a couple of minutes before they come out of the oven.
While your burgers are cooking, get your toppings ready. I go with avocado, tomato relish and the quick cucumber pickle above, plus a few spinach leaves. Hummus, grated carrot and sprouts is another favourite, but feel free to improvise and try it your own way.
Once the burgers are golden, toast your buns and layer up your burgers. I like to serve them with the sweet potato fries. You can’t beat a burger and chips, and these ones are as healthy as they are tasty.

Ingredients

For the spiced apple:
1 bramley apple
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp ginger
½ tsp nutmeg
1 tbsp maple syrup
2 tbsp water
For the blondie mix:
1 tin chickpeas
1 tbsp flax seeds, 3 tbsp water
2 tsp coconut oil (solid)
1 tbsp maple syrup
8 dates, pitted
50g organic sultanas (oil-free)
2 tbsp desiccated coconut
10 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tsp baking powder
½ tsp Himalayan pink salt
1 tbsp chia seeds, to decorate

","
Preparation
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes

Method

Heat the oven to 180°C / 350°F / Gas Mark 4.
Prepare the flax ‘egg’ by combining the flax seeds and water in a bowl and popping it in the fridge for around 15 minutes.
Put the coconut oil into a ramekin and heat in the oven for 5 minutes, until melted.
Peel and core the apple and chop it into small pieces. In a saucepan, cook on a medium heat with the maple syrup, water and spices. Simmer until you have something resembling apple puree, stirring occasionally to ensure the maple syrup isn’t burning and most of the water has evaporated. Set aside to cool.
While the apple is cooking you can start to make the blonde mix. Drain and rinse the chickpeas and put these, together with the dates and the flax egg, into a mixing bowl. Use an electronic hand blender or processor to combine.
If you need to, use a little of the melted oil to grease a brownie tin and add the rest to the blondie mix.
Stir in the remaining ingredients, except the chia seeds. If the mixture looks too dry you can add a tbsp of non-dairy milk (this will depend on the amount of moisture in your apple puree).
Pour the mixture into a brownie tin and spread evenly with a spatula. Sprinkle the chia seeds across the top and bake in the oven for 25 minutes.
Once cooled, remove from the tin to a cooling rack. Slice into squares and store in the fridge: they will firm up and keep for longer.

Ingredients

400g of gluten-free oats (equivalent to two yoghurt cartons filled with oats. We used Bunalun)
1 500g tub of Alpro plain yoghurt (or equivalent)
1 tsp baking soda
½ tsp salt
1 tbsp soya milk (or any plant-based milk you want)
1 tbsp treacle
A handful of mixed seeds

","
Preparation
Preheat oven to 180 c/ 350 f/ Gas mark 4.

Method

Line your bread tin with greaseproof paper or grease it with oil or soya butter.


Add the full tub of Alpro yoghurt to a large bowl.


Fill the empty yoghurt tub with oats and pour that amount into the bowl with the yoghurt. Scrape out any bits sticking to the sides.


Repeat this step so you should have 2 yoghurt tub measures full of porridge oats in the bowl.


Add all the rest of your ingredients to the bowl too.


Fold all your ingredients together.


If it seems a bit dry add another tbsp of milk until the mixture is like a wet oaty dough.


When the mixture is well combined add it to your bread tin and smooth the top.


Sprinkle the seeds over the top.


Bake for approx. 45 – 55 minutes and when it is 10 minutes from the end take the bread out of the tin and turn it upside down in the tine and put back into the oven. Cook it like that for the last 10 minutes.


When it’s ready take it out and turn it upside down on a wire rack and leave it until it’s cool. Then enjoy!

493,https://veganuary.com/recipes/cool-sesame-dino-kale-yuba-noodles/,Cool Sesame & Dino Kale Yuba Noodles,"
Ingredients

1 pack of Hodo Yuba sheets
1 bunch of lacinato kale
1/3 cup tahini
1/3 cup rice vinegar
4 T gluten-free tamari
2 t sesame oil
1 t sugar
1/3 T salt
7g ginger
5 cloves garlic
Optional to garnish: julienned cucumbers, toasted sesame seeds, chopped parseley and/or cilantro, red chili flakes

","
Method

Remove Yuba from packet and place on cutting board. (There’s no need to unfold the sheets, but if you are unfamiliar with the yuba, there are two folded sheets in the pack, FYI!) Cut yuba to desired width, like you would with regular pasta – for this dish, I prefer about 1/2″ wide noodles. Toss cut yuba into a large mixing bowl and pull apart to separate.
Rinse the kale and strip the main vein out, reserve to snack on, stir-fry or pickle! Cut similarly to the yuba noodles in width (hint: cut lengthwise to get longer rather than shorter strips.) Toss chopped kale in with the yuba and set aside.
For the sesame sauce, these are the basic ingredient quantities, but as always, adjust to taste! (You can use this sauce with anything, by the way, regular noodles, as a dipping sauce for veggies & tofu, etc etc etc.) Peel ginger and grate, conserving the liquid as well. Peel and mince the garlic (I tend to drop both ginger and garlic into the food processor at the same time and mince into almost a paste.) Add all other ingredients and puree together.
Add sauce to yuba and kale and mix well! Garnish as you like. As a side dish, serves 4-6 and as a main, 2-3.
Sesame sauce can be prepared up to a few days in advance.  The salad can be prepared a day in advance – yuba and kale both hold up very well, and the kale actually softens up a bit with time!  (Perfect for picnic planning.)

1kg floury potatoes – I recommend Maris Pipers or King Edwards
4 tbsp olive oil
5 cloves of garlic
3 stems of rosemary
1 jar of roasted peppers in oil
For the tahini sauce:
1 tbsp tahini, light or dark
2 tbsp water
1 tbsp olive oil – or use the oil from the jar of peppers
1 tsp cider vinegar, or 1 tbsp lemon juice 
1 tsp maple syrup

","
Preparation

Serves 4, as an accompaniment


Method
Peel and cut the potatoes into large bite size chunks. Place them in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil and then leave at a rolling simmer for 10 minutes.   Meanwhile, pour the oil into a large mixing bowl and add the garlic cloves (skin on) and a generous pinch of sea salt.
Drain the potatoes and then tip into the bowl of oil and garlic. Mix together, not minding if the potatoes mar on the edges – this will add to their crispness later. Tip the potatoes onto a baking tray, scatter over the rosemary and roast for 1 hour in the oven or until golden and crunchy.
While the potatoes are roasting, make up the tahini sauce. Place the tahini and water into a bowl and stir together until completely smooth. Pour in the oil, cider vinegar (or lemon juice if using), maple syrup and season with salt and pepper. Stir together until you have a smooth and creamy sauce. Taste and add any extra seasoning if you think it needs it.
When the potatoes are ready, and crisp and golden, tip them out onto a serving platter, discarding the rosemary stalks and taking the roasted garlic cloves and squeezing the soft garlic interior into the tahini sauce.  Now scatter over the peppers and mix with the potatoes, before drizzling over the tahini sauce and serving immediately.

3 x celery stalks
About 10cm of cucumber
2 x gherkins
A good handful of kalamata and green olives
Half a bag of ready-to-eat puy lentils
1 x packet of Cauldron marinated tofu (or similar by another brand)
Balsamic vinegar
Olive oil
Sunflower seeds (toasted)
Salt and pepper to taste

","
Preparation
Serves 2 as a big lunch, or 4 if having something with it – like bread and (more) olives, and other tapas-y things.

Method
You can really do this in any particular order. Ultimately it all gets mixed up!

In a fry pan chuck a good handful or two of sunflower seeds and dry fry. You want them slightly browned, so they have a lovely nutty taste. Put them to the side while you do the rest
Rip up the lettuce heads into a colander and wash. Then add the kale and wash, massaging as you go. (Massaging kale seems hilarious at first, but it does help it to soften, and basically you’re just rubbing it between your fingers. When I first started eating raw kale I found it quite tough, so the more you massage it then softer it gets. If the kale is very fresh you may hardly need to do this. It really is a case of personal taste. I don’t notice the toughness of kale in the same way I used to, because I eat it such a lot.) Rip the kale and lettuce into smaller pieces, and discard any woody kale stalks
Chop up your peppers, celery, cucumber, gherkins, olives and chuck in a big bowl
Add the puy lentils and marinated tofu and mix well
Add the lettuce and kale bit by bit, mixing as you go. A good salad is one where you get a bit of everything, so try to evenly distribute
Add the sunflower seeds, a good splash of olive oil and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar
Crack pepper over the top and a little salt if you think it needs it
Serve in big bowls and enjoy!

Additions: Crusty bread, hummus, more olives, guacamole, aubergine dip or a tomato, red onion and basil salad all go well with this. Create a table of colour with the salad as the centre piece! Also perfect picnic grub on a lovely summer day. This is a filling salad though, and delicious just as it is.

4. To make the sauce, roughly chop the onion and garlic cloves. Then chop the ginger,
slightly smaller than the onion and garlic. Then add to a blender and blend until smooth.
5. To make the sauce add some oil to a pan on a medium heat. Add the paste, making sure to stir often. If it begins to stick you can add a little water. Cook until golden brown. Add garam masala, curry powder and ground turmeric and mix for a minute. Then slowly add more water until you get the desired sauce consistency. Then add a little more water and leave on a low heat, stirring occasionally.
6. Remove the skins from roasted squash pieces.

503,https://veganuary.com/recipes/summer-rolls-2/,Summer Rolls,"
Ingredients

1 small red cabbage
2 carrots
1 cucumber
Bunch of spring onions
Bunch of fresh coriander
1 or 2 limes
Soy sauce
Marinated tofu (either pre-bought or homemade)
Crushed peanuts
Dipping sauce of your choice (sweet chilli, sriracha etc)
1 pack of rice paper

","
Preparation
The key to this recipe is the preparation, which only takes about 10 minutes, so first things first get your veggies and condiments ready and arranged in front of you.

Shred the cabbage and carrot, if you have a food processor with a slicer attachment then that’s perfect, otherwise julienne or grate them.
Cut the cucumber into inch-long lengths and then match-stick them.
Cut the spring onions into inch-long lengths and then cut into quarters.
Smash up the peanuts (use plain, non-roasted with no skins).
Cut the limes into quarters (if you bash them on the work surface before cutting them you’ll get more juice out).
Get the marinated tofu out and ready in front of you.
Roughly chop the coriander.

Making these is a bit like a production line, so arrange all of the above in a way that all the pieces are accessible, then open the rice paper and get a large, shallow dish and fill it with warm water.

Method
1) Soak one sheet of rice paper in the warm water until it becomes pliable, but not totally floppy. This should be about 10 – 20 seconds; it’ll continue to soften up once you take it out of the water.
2) Lay the sheet of rice paper in front of you, and then add into the middle of the rice paper in a line, the cabbage, carrot, cucumber and spring onion, tofu, a pinch of peanuts and coriander and a squeeze of lime. The trick here is to not overfill them as you’re going to roll them up.
3) Fold in the left and right sides of the rice paper, then fold up the bottom to cover the ingredients (think of making an envelope), then roll the rice paper and ingredients to make a roll.
4) Place on a plate and repeat steps 1-3 until you have enough summer rolls.
5) Serve with additional lime and coriander and with a selection of dipping sauces.

Ingredients

vegan butter, room temp
1/4 Cup / 50g almond butter
4 pieces of whole grain bread
1/2 Cup / 100g fresh berries of your choice
A few mint leaves, torn to shreds
2 Tbsp maple syrup or coconut nectar

","
Preparation
Makes 2 sandwiches

Method

Spread a small amount of butter on one side of each slice of bread, make sure it is room temp and spreadable.
Smear almond butter over the unbuttered side of two of the pieces of bread. Top with a generous amount of fresh berries in any artistic way you like, add a few mint leaves, don’t be shy about piling them on. Drizzle maple syrup on top of the berries and place the other slice of bread, buttered side up, on top.
On medium heat, heat up a cast iron or grill pan. Place the sandwich into the pan and press down lightly with a spatula. After a minute, flip and repeat on the other side, repeat as needed until golden brown.  Much like roasting marshmallows over an open fire, heat until your desired griddled colour is achieved.
Remove from heat, slice into fourths, garnish with fresh mint and serve warm.

OPTIONS: Try this with all sorts of combos, different seasonal berries, fresh sliced strawberries etc.  Works great when you’re trying to cut down on processed sugar intake and sugary jams.

For the Stew:
2 Tbsp olive oil
1 large onion, finely sliced
4 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
1 tsp fresh parsley stalks
½ tsp ground cumin
½ tsp ground coriander
¼ tsp ground nutmeg
1 tsp ground cinnamon
½ tsp smoked paprika
¼ tsp ground cloves
2 aubergines (eggplant) (approx 600g), halved lengthways then sliced into 1cm semicircles
1 x 400g tin chickpeas, drained (keep the liquid to use for aquafaba in another recipe)
2 x 400g tins peeled plum tomatoes
1 Tbsp light brown sugar
500ml vegetable stock
Juice of 1 lemon
For the Flatbreads:
130g strong white bread flour
350g plain white flour
1 tsp fine sea salt
300ml lukewarm water
2 tsp quick yeast
1 tsp sugar

","
Method
To Make the Stew:

Preheat the oven to 200c (fan).
Place a cast-iron dutch oven (with lid) over a medium/low heat and add the oil.
Once the pan is to temperature, add the onion and fry lightly for a minute. Add the garlic and parsley stalks before frying for a further 2 minutes. Do not allow the onions or garlic to brown.
Add the spices and stir well to coat the onion. Add the aubergine, chickpeas, tinned tomatoes, brown sugar, and vegetable stock. Stir well.
Cover the pot with the lid and place in the preheated oven for 90 minutes, removing to stir every half hour.
While the stew cooks, make the flatbreads.

To Make the Flatbreads:

Combine the flours and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. If you don’t have a stand mixer, just use a medium sized bowl.
Place 100 ml of the water into a small bowl and add the sugar and yeast. Mix well and set aside to allow the yeast to bloom.
Mix the yeast mixture into the flour along with the rest of the water. If using a stand mixer, knead using the dough hook attachment for roughly 8-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth. If kneading by hand, sprinkle a counter with flour and knead vigorously for 8-10 minutes.
Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea-towel and leave to proof somewhere room temperature for at least one hour.
Once proofed, punch down the dough to remove the larger air bubbles.
Lightly flour a rimmed baking tray. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and slice the dough into 8 even pieces. Roll them into tight balls and place on the floured tray to prove, covered with a damp tea-towel. Leave to proof a second time for around 40 minutes.
Once proofed, roll out each ball to around 15cm. Place a dry, cast-iron skillet over medium heat.
Place one flatbread in the skillet and cook until puffed and bubbly. Flip after around 3 minutes, making sure the bottom isn’t burning. Cook for a further minute or two on the second side before removing. Repeat with all of the flatbreads. Wrap the cooked flatbreads in a clean tea-towel to keep them warm.

Ingredients

FOR THE CAULIFLOWER-CASHEW BUTTAH BASE:
1 small head cauliflower, bottom stem removed, cleaned and dismembered into large pieces
1 Cup / 200g raw cashews, soaked in water for at least 1 hour (or overnight), then strained and rinsed
4-5 medium garlic cloves
1/2 tsp coarse salt
2 Tbsp rice vinegar
1 bay leaf
2 cups water
FOR THE EGGPLANT:
1-2 medium-sized eggplants
2 Tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp coarse salt (Jacobsen’s sea salt)
1/2 Cup / 100g cauliflower buttah
300g crushed Kettle potato chips (Salt & Cracked Pepper)
4 cherry tomatoes, sliced
Small handful of fresh basil leaves, washed and lightly packed

","
Preparation
Serves 2-4

Method
To make the cauliflower-cashew buttah base

In a medium-sized sauce pot, add the dismembered cauliflower, cashews, garlic, salt, rice vinegar and bay leaf along with 2 cups of water and cover.
Heat on medium-high until it reaches a slow boil, then steam for 10-15 minutes until the cauliflower is cooked throughout and breaks apart easily. Let it cool, then strain and remove the bay leaf.
Transfer the mixture to a high-speed blender. Start blending on low speed and, using damper/plunger, mash all the ingredients down to ensure everything gets blended. Add a few splashes of water or non-dairy milk only if absolutely needed (we’re looking to create as thick of a mixture as possible for the buttah so the less liquid the better). Once completely blended and smooth, measure out 1/2 cup of the butter and chill the rest for another use.
Save the remaining buttah base in a closed container in the fridge for up to a week.

To make the eggplant

Preheat oven to 375. Lightly oil a baking sheet.
To prep the eggplant, slice it in half lengthwise and score the inside without piercing the skin, with one tablespoon of oil rubbed into each top half. Season with the salt. Spread a thin layer of cauliflower buttah on the open face of each half allowing some to get between the slices.
On a separate plate, apply potato chip crust to cover the open eggplant flesh. Add a few dollops of cauliflower buttah to the top and place sliced tomatoes along with and bake face side up for 40-45 minutes.
Remove from heat garnish with fresh basil leaves and serve.

1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon organic all-purpose flour
1/2 cup organic whole wheat pastry flour 
1/2 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder
1/2 cup minus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1/4 cup organic whole cane sugar, ground in a blender until powdered
2 tablespoons arrowroot or organic cornstarch 
1 teaspoon aluminum-free baking powder
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons mild tasting extra-virgin olive oil or organic neutral vegetable oil
1/4 cup pure maple syrup, Grade B or dark amber 
1/4 cup any non-dairy milk
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon chocolate extract (optional)
Heaped 1/4 cup vegan chocolate chips or mini chunks
1/3 cup lightly toasted walnuts or mixed nuts, coarsely chopped (optional)

","
Preparation
Note: If using coconut oil as the fat, make sure the other ingredients are at room temperature, or the oil will harden into clumps during mixing.

Makes one 8 X 8-inch square pan


Method

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350° F. Oil an 8 x 8-inch square pan and then line the bottom with parchment paper. Do not oil the paper.
Place a wire mesh strainer over a medium bowl. Add the all-purpose flour, pastry flour, cocoa, granulated sugar, whole cane sugar, arrowroot or cornstarch, baking powder, and salt to the strainer and stir with a whisk to sift the ingredients into the bowl. (If any small bits remain in the strainer, add them to the mixture in the bowl.) Whisk to aerate the mixture.
Whisk the oil, maple syrup, nondairy milk, vanilla, and chocolate extract, if using, in a separate medium bowl until completely combined. Pour into the dry ingredients and mix with a silicone spatula until the batter, which will be thick, is smooth. Allow the batter to rest for ten minutes.
Stir the chocolate chips and nuts, if using, into the batter. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan, and spread into an even layer with a metal spatula.
Bake for 23 minutes until the top is set and dry and the sides have pulled just slightly away from the pan.
Remove the pan from the oven and set on a cooling rack. Immediately insert a wooden tester diagonally into the brownies. The tester will be coated with batter, but not wet. If necessary, bake for another minute.
Cool to room temperature. The middle of the cake will sink as it cools; don’t worry. Once cold you can push the sides down to level the cake if you like. Refrigerate until very cold before cutting into squares.

Keeping: Refrigerate the brownies in a covered container, in layers separated by parchment, for up to three days, or freeze for up to one month. Defrost unwrapped or eat straight out of the freezer.

4 celery stalks
2 large carrots (or 4 small ones…)
2 parsnips
500ml veg stock made with 2 vegetable stock cubes
1 tbsp soya butter
1 tbsp Herbes de Provence
1 dsp (dessert spoon) flour
Salt (optional) and black pepper

","
Method

Wash and peel all the veg and cut them into large chunks at an angle.


Melt the butter in a large sauce pan and add the chopped onions once melted.


Cook the onions until they soften and are coated in the butter. Around 4 minutes maybe.


Add the herbs then and stir to coat the onions in the herbs.


Then add the flour and stir to make sure this mixture doesn’t stick to the pan. Let the flour and the herbs cook with the onions for a few minutes so the butter absorbs the flavour.


Then add the stock very slowly. Add in just a little bit at a time stirring all the time. This will form a kind of gravy-like liquid.


Then add in the rest of the vegetables and if you think the mixture needs more liquid just add in a bit more boiling water.


Add some black pepper and salt if you think it needs it (I didn’t use salt).


Put a lid on then and let it simmer on a low heat for around an hour or until the veg are cooked.


Serve with spuds anyway you like!

1 pack Oumph! Kebab Spiced (280g)
For the glaze:
1 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp tamari soy sauce
¼ tsp crushed black pepper
1 tbsp rapeseed oil
For the tzatziki dip:
1 large cucumber, shredded
2 tsp salt
350g dairy-free yoghurt
Juice of 1 lemon
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tbsp fresh dill
To serve:
Toasted fresh pita breads.
","
Method
Fire up your BBQ and wait 30 minutes until the coals are glowing and hot, hot, hot.
In the meantime, wash and half the peaches and allow for the Oumph! Kebab Spiced to defrost, and pierce them onto skewers. If you’re using wooden skewers on your BBQ then make sure to soak them in water for at least an hour before using.
For the glaze, simply mix maple syrup, tamari, black pepper and rapeseed oil in a small bowl, then brush your skewers with the glaze before placing them onto the hot BBQ. Turn the skewers regularly until the peaches are starting to caramelise and the kebab is lightly browned.
To prepare the tzatziki dip, finely shred the cucumber with a grater or a food processor, then transfer the shreds to a nut milk bag or a clean kitchen towel and squeeze out as much of the water as you can.
Transfer the cucumber shreds to a large bowl and stir in the salt, then allow it to rest for 10 minutes and squeeze out any releasing liquid again. Mix the cucumber and salt with the dairy-free yoghurt, lemon juice, garlic and fresh dill.
To serve, drizzle the grilled peach & kebab skewers with a little tzatziki and use the rest to dip some freshly toasted pitta bread.

1 -2 tablespoons of oil
250ml of vegan gravy (keep it quite thick). If you can’t find any, then you could use vegetable stock and gravy browning.
1 Tbsp. ketchup
2 teaspoons Henderson’s relish (or vegan Worcestershire sauce)
Black pepper (to taste, I used a lot)
1⁄2 teaspoon oregano
1 pack of ready to roll shortcrust pastry (Jus-Rol is vegan)
1 pack of ready to roll puff pastry (Jus-Rol is vegan)

The filling can also be frozen and then used at a future date. 

Method
The filling:

Finely chop the onion and soften in a large pan with the oil.


Once softened, add the soya mince and cook-off, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. The kind of soya mince I used needed to be rehydrated first so make sure you follow the instructions for that. If you are using frozen, break it up a bit and add it to the pan.


Add in the gravy, ketchup, Henderson’s, pepper and oregano to the pan. Stir it all together then cook over a medium heat. Try to reduce the mixture down so that it’s not too wet. You should be able to drag a spoon through the pan and have the mixture stay apart for a few seconds.


This can then be refrigerated until you are ready to use it. It will freeze too so you can make lots this time and then defrost ahead of time in the future.

The pie:

Get your pie dish or dishes ready and roll out the shortcrust pastry as per the instructions so you have enough to cover the bottom and the sides of your dish. This is a proper pie, not a stew with a puff pastry hat on.


Line the bottom and sides of your dish with the pastry and then blind bake at 200C for around 15 mins until the pastry turns golden. You can prick the pastry on the bottom of the pan with a knife to stop it rising up and help it cook a little better.


While your pastry is blind baking, you can roll out your puff pastry for the top as per the instructions on the packet.


Once your shortcrust is ready, add the filling and then place the puff pastry on top. Crimp around the edges and then make a couple of holes in the top with a sharp knife to let the steam out.


Brush with soya milk (or other non-sweet plant milk) and bake at 200C for around 30 mins or until the top is lovely and golden.

Ingredients

Olive Oil
1 x large onion (white or red)
3 x cloves of garlic
Teaspoon of cumin powder
Teaspoon of coriander
Good splash of soy sauce
Good squirt of tomato puree
2 x carrots
2 x celery stalks
Half a teaspoon (or more if you like spice) of cayenne pepper
Half a teaspoon of smoked paprika
Good splash of your favourite hot sauce (optional)
1 x tin chickpeas
1 x tin kidney beans
1 x tin cannellini beans
2 x tins of chopped tomatoes
Salt and pepper to taste

","
Preparation
Serves 4, or 2 with leftovers 
This is a meal that you will make again and again, so use my ingredients as a guide and experiment with what you like best. I also like it hot, so go easy on the cayenne, paprika and hot sauce if you’re not a fan. You can choose whatever beans you like, but I recommend 3 x tins whatever combination you choose. This is a hearty meal, and one that tastes better the next day. Great on toast for lunch!

Method

Put a good splash of olive oil in a pot and get it on a low/medium heat
Chop up your onion and toss in the pot
Chop up your garlic and throw in after a couple of minutes
Add your cumin, coriander, paprika and cayenne and mix well
Add your soy sauce and tomato puree and mix
Chop up your carrots and put them in (I typically slice them down the middle, down the middle again, and then across into little chunks)
Then goes your celery, chopped, but not too fine (the carrot and celery add texture and a bit of crunch)
Open your tins of beans, pour into a colander and rinse well in cold water
Add all the beans to the pot and mix well
Add the 2 x tins of tomatoes and mix again
Salt and pepper to taste and then leave simmering away for a good 30 minutes
Taste before serving – if it tastes great then you’re ready!

If you make in advance, leave simmering for 30 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, and then let it sit covered for a few hours. Heat up again before serving. These flavours love getting to know each other, so a little time is never a bad thing.
Enjoy!

532,https://veganuary.com/recipes/coconut-bacon/,Coconut Bacon,"
Ingredients

2 tablespoons liquid smoke (hickory or mesquite flavor)
2 tablespoons tamari soy sauce
1 tablespoon maple syrup or agave nectar
1 tablespoon water
3½ cups (200 g) unsweetened coconut flakes

","
Preparation
Makes 3½ cups

Method
Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, stir together the liquid smoke, tamari soy sauce, maple syrup or agave nectar, and water.
Add the coconut flakes to the bowl, and using a rubber spatula, gently toss together the coconut with the liquid mixture until the coconut flakes are thoroughly coated.
Transfer the coated coconut flakes onto the prepared baking sheet, spreading them out in a single layer so they cook evenly, and place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, and stay close by.
After 10 or 15 minutes and every 5 minutes thereafter, you will want to toss and flip the flakes using a spatula. This is not only to make sure the flakes cook evenly but also to ensure that they don’t burn, and they will burn if you don’t regularly toss them.
Depending on your oven, you may also need to turn the baking sheet around to ensure they cook up evenly. As you continue to check, feel free to taste to make sure they’re nice and crispy. They will be a nice brown color when they’re done, and if you test them, you’ll notice the coconut flavor is pretty much gone.
Remove from the oven, and let cool before storing in a sealed bag or container. (They continue to crisp up as they cool.) The coconut bacon will stay fresh for up to 3 weeks—in or out of the refrigerator.
Suggestions for Serving

Make a classic Bacon, Lettuce, and Tomato Sandwich with some avocado slices!
Top a baked potato with a couple tablespoons, as you would with bacon bits.
Offer the coconut bacon as an option for a salad topping.
It’s a great garnish for soup.
Sprinkle them on top of your favorite Macaroni & Cheese recipe or on top of pasta.

For Your Information
Look for unsweetened coconut flakes in the bulk section of your grocery store; packaged brands include Edward & Sons/Let’s Do Organic and Bob’s Red Mill (USA only).
For Your Edification
Liquid smoke adds a wonderful depth of flavor to so many dishes, and a little goes a long way. It’s a great staple to keep in the cupboard, and you’ll find yourself using it often to add a smoky flavor to your favorite recipes.

1/3 cup of oats
1 tbsp raw cacao
3/4 cup of plant milk
Dash of maple syrup
1 dragon fruit (can substitute with pear, apple or pineapple)
1 kiwi fruit

Preparation
First you will have to create each layer. Do it the night before to save time and also to allow each layer set nicely

Method
Chia layer: 2 tbsp of chia seeds, 3/4 cup of coconut or any other plant based milk. Mix all together and pop  in the fridge. After 15 min take it out and stir to avoid lumps. Put back in the fridge to set overnight.
Mango layer: Just simply cut up your mango into small pieces and blend with your blender.
Chocolate layer: 1/3 cup of oats, 1 tbsp of raw cacao , 3/4 cup of plant based milk and little bit of maple syrup. Mix it all together and put in the fridge to set overnight.
Dragon fruit layer: Simply cut up your dragon fruit and blend with your blender. If you don’t have dragon fruit you can use any other fruit such as pineapple, pear or even apple.
Kiwi layer: Peel your kiwi and blend with your blender.
In the morning pour each of the layers in to a glass very carefully, I used a small spoon. This way you will avoid mixing all layers together. Top up with gojiberries, desiccated coconut, or hemp seeds.

539,https://veganuary.com/recipes/mediterranean-style-roasted-miniature-aubergines/,Mediterranean-Style Roasted Miniature Aubergines,"
Ingredients

6 miniature aubergines
6 cloves garlic
minced
2 tsp lemon juice
2 tsp extra virgin olive oil
1 tbsp dried oregano

","
Preparation
If you’re not able to find this variety of aubergine in your local shop, substitute with two regular aubergines sliced in half and cook for a little longer.
Note: I don’t often cook with extra virgin olive oil – I think it’s better for dressings or for dipping with bread- but the aubergines in this recipe really soak up the flavour, so I think it’s worthwhile.
For this recipe, use a good non-stick roasting tray, or line a tray with parchment paper.

Method

Heat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
Slice off the stalk end from each aubergine and then slice each one in half lengthways.
Add the minced garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and oregano to the tray and give it all a good stir, spreading it evenly across the surface.
Arrange the aubergine halves on the tray, flesh-side down, ensuring all have a good coating of the oil mixture.
Cook for 25 minutes. When you remove them after this time the skins should be slightly wrinkly.
Turn each half over, cover the tray with tin foil and return to cook for a further 20-25 minutes.
The aubergines are just right when they’re starting to dissolve slightly, but still hold their shape.

I love to eat this dish with a fresh tomato, red onion, olive and basil salad and some lovely bread to soak up the juices. You could even scoop out the flesh and mash it together to create a ready-made baba ghanoush!

Good slug of olive oil
1 x large onion (red or white, whatever you prefer/have in the cupboard)
3/4 big cloves of garlic, finely chopped
A good chunk of ginger, peeled and diced finely (about the same amount in total as the garlic)
1 x large lemon
Teaspoon of cumin
Half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper
3/4 sundried tomatoes from a jar (chopped as finely as you can get them)
Handful of cherry tomatoes
1 x cup of red lentils
1 x tin of chickpeas

2 x cups of vegan veggie stock (I use Bouillon)
1 x cup of water
Cracked pepper to taste

Method
Moroccan Lentil, Chickpea and Kale Soup. A hearty vegan soup, packed full of protein.
I’m a bit of a chuck-it-in-and-taste as I go kind of girl, so please forgive the lack of ‘absoluteness’ with this recipe. But this really is a soup you will make your own, so adapt the flavours to suit your own tastes. I like spicy food, so maybe go easy on the cayenne for the first run…

Put some olive oil in a pan and get it on a low heat
Chop up your onion and chuck in the pan
Chop/mince up your garlic and ginger and add to the pan
Add the cumin and cayenne and stir well
Wash your lemon and chop into fairly chunky slices – I pretty much use the entire lemon as I just love the flavour, but you may want to use three slices to begin with – and add to the pan
Add the finely chopped sundried tomatoes and mix in
In a separate bowl, wash your lentils and drain – set aside
In a colander, empty 1 tin of chickpeas and wash well
Add the lentils to the pan and mix well
Add the chickpeas to the pan and mix well
Cut your cherry tomatoes into quarters and add to the mix
Open a can of chopped tomatoes and pour into the pan – mix well
In order to get out the remaining tomato/juice from the can, fill with cold water and pour into the pan (roughly 1 cup of water)
Add enough water to the kettle for two more cups and switch on
Mix up your veggie stock and add to the pan
Mix well and cover with lid, leave covered for approximately 10 minutes (this gives you time to tidy/wash up what you’ve used so far)
Put kale in colander and wash. Leave on side, ready for later
The soup needs about 20/30 mins to thicken (lid off), and needs stirring every now and then. It should be simmering hot, but not boiling
When you are happy that it’s pretty much ready, roughly chop your kale and add to the soup
Simmer for an additional 5 minutes or so and then your soup is ready to serve
Add pepper to taste or for garnish
Dig in!

This is lovely served with Marmite and Violife cheese on hot/toasted ciabatta, and makes a delicious filling lunch the next day. Packed with flavour, protein and goodness, this is a soup I make as soon as I feel the hint of a sniffle… Add extra cayenne, garlic and ginger to blast that cold right away!

Ingredients

3 large bananas
Plant milk (only a little)
Vegan chocolate for melting
Chopped nuts

","
Preparation
Special thanks to Victoria Harley for the image: split-pin.co.uk

Method

Peel and chop the bananas into thick slices
Lay flat on a tray or plate, and place in freezer for at least two hours
Just before the two hours is up, melt some chocolate in a pan, and crush/chop your nuts
Put frozen banana slices in a blender and whizz  – you will need to stop and give it a stir with a spoon/break up bananas a few times, as it takes a while for them to stop being more than just icy slices
Almost suddenly it will become creamy like ice cream… If you’re not seeing this, add a dash or two of plant milk and blend until it does
This is best served almost immediately, so spoon into bowls, pour on melted chocolate, sprinkle on the nuts, and serve
Enjoy!

While the sweet potato is cooking prepare the couscous.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large sauté pan, add the couscous and cook gently for 2–3 minutes until starting to brown.
Add half of the stock or water to the pan and continue to cook for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently until the couscous is tender and has absorbed the liquid.
Add the remaining stock or water to the pan as and when needed.
Add the raisins, za’tar and chopped pistachios to the pan, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and cool slightly.
Mix together the juice from half the lemon and the extra virgin olive oil and pour over the warm sweet potato when it comes out of the oven.
Gently stir the freshly chopped herbs and roasted sweet potato wedges into the couscous and serve with extra lemon wedges for squeezing over.

Ingredients

1 pot of Seabloom ‘Tuna Free’ Flakes (100g)
250g pasta (linguine is best, but spaghetti will also work well)
175g cherry tomatoes, washed and halved
35g pitted olives, halved
20g capers
1 handful of finely chopped parsley + some for serving
1 tbs olive oil
salt and pepper to taste
fresh lemon juice to serve

Ingredients
1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 onion, diced
5 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp coriander
2 tsp ground cumin
2 cups fresh spinach, chopped
2 cups black beans, chopped in a food processor (canned organic is fine)
4 tbsp shoyu
3 cups cooked, mashed sweet potatoes
Sea salt, to taste
10 large tortillas
Vegan cheese and spring onions for topping
Salsa
","
Method

Preheat oven to 180º C /360 ºF / Gas Mark 4.
Heat the olive oil in a medium pan over a low/medium heat. Add onion and garlic, sauté until onion is translucent. Add coriander and cumin.
Cook for two minutes stirring constantly adding a little water if the pan seems dry.
Add the spinach, black beans, soy sauce and mashed sweet potatoes. Cook for 3-5 minutes. Remove from heat and season with sea salt.
Place ¼ cup of mixture in centre of tortilla. Roll into a burrito and place in a non-stick baking dish.
Once all the burritos are assembled, pour your favourite salsa on top and cover with aluminium foil.
Bake for 25 minutes.
Remove and sprinkle with melty vegan cheese and return to over for 2-5 minutes (until the cheese is melted).
Garnish with sliced spring onions and serve!

Mild Homemade Salsa:
If you do not like things hot (or even warm for that matter!), this is the perfect salsa. You can build your tolerance to greater heat levels if you so desire. Just start with a very little bit of hot pepper.

8 fresh vine ripe tomatoes, chopped
½ cup fresh coriander, chopped
2 onions, chopped
1 bell pepper, yellow, orange or red
½ tsp seal salt
1 lime, juiced

Combine all the chopped ingredients into a bowl stir lightly. Squeeze the lime juice over the homemade salsa.  If you prefer, you can use a stick blender and create a less chunky salsa. This flavourful, mild homemade salsa can be served immediately, but its flavour will be enhanced if you let the tastes develop overnight in the fridge.

547,https://veganuary.com/recipes/bedeviled-eggless-eggs/,Bedeviled Eggless Eggs,"
Ingredients

Ingredients for the “egg whites”:
⅓ block (about 4 oz) extra-firm water-packed tofu, pressed 
¾ tsp kala namak (Himalayan black salt)
2 cups water
2 and ¼ tsp agar powder or 3 T agar flakes
Ingredients for the “yolk” filling:
⅔ block (about 8 oz) extra-firm water-packed tofu, pressed 
3 tbsp vegan mayonnaise
1 tbsp nutritional yeast flakes
1 tbsp dill pickle brine
2 tsp Dijon mustard or spicy golden mustard
½ tsp onion powder
¼ tsp kala namak* (Himalayan black salt), or more to taste
¼ tsp turmeric
¼ tsp paprika (for extra bedeviling, use cayenne pepper)
Garnishes:
Paprika and coarse ground black pepper
Optional: sliced black olives; fresh snipped chives; capers; chopped cornichons; chopped dill

","
Preparation

A blender is required for preparing the “egg whites” and a food processor is recommended for the “yolk filling”. You will also need an 8” square baking pan and 1 block (14 oz) of extra-firm water-packed tofu. If you have chocolate egg molds, or a heat-proof container that specifically holds deviled eggs, the “egg white” mixture can be poured into the molds to create perfect, halved hard-boiled egg shapes. This recipe yields 16 to 24 bedeviled eggless eggs, or more depending upon the mold(s) used for the “egg whites”.


Method
Drain and press the tofu until it is not releasing any more liquid – this is very important! After pressing you will have approximately 12 oz of tofu. Slice ⅓ of the tofu to use for the “egg whites. The remaining ⅔ will be used for the “yolk” filling.
To prepare the “egg whites”, place the “egg white” ingredients into a blender and process until smooth. Pour the mixture into a saucepan and bring to rapid simmer over medium heat, stirring frequently to avoid scorching the tofu mixture. Pour the mixture into the 8” baking pan and set aside to cool. If you have chocolate egg molds, or a heat-proof container that specifically holds deviled eggs, pour the tofu mixture directly into the molds and set aside to cool.
Next, crumble the ⅔ block of pressed tofu into the food processor and add the remaining “yolk” filling ingredients. Process the contents until completely smooth, stopping as necessary to scrape down the sides of the food processor. Alternately, the mixture can be mashed using a fork or a potato masher/ricer, but the mixture will not be as smooth.
Transfer the “yolk” mixture to a bowl or food storage container, season with additional kala namak if desired, cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Cover the baking pan with plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate until the “egg whites” have completely set, or a minimum of 30 minutes.
Now, run a table knife around the perimeter of the baking pan to loosen the “egg white” (or simply pop them out of the chocolate egg molds). Invert the baking pan onto a clean work surface. At this point, the “egg white” can be cut into rectangles or cut into rounds or ovals.
For rectangles, cut the “egg whites” into 6 even strips. Turn your cutting surface and make 4 even slices. This will create 24 rectangles. For rounds or ovals, use a 1 and ½-inch to 1 and ¾-inch cookie cutter or ring mold. Any “egg white” remnants can be finely diced and mixed with any of the leftover “yolk” filling for a quick eggless egg salad sandwich.
Spoon a generous teaspoonful of the “yolk” mixture onto the top of each “egg white”. Alternately, the mixture can be decoratively piped onto the “egg whites” using a pastry bag. If you don’t have a pastry bag, try placing the mixture into a zip-lock bag, seal and then snip off a tiny piece from the bottom corner of the bag with scissors. Squeeze the bag to pipe the mixture onto the “egg whites”.
Sprinkle with paprika and garnish with optional ingredients as desired. Cover gently with plastic wrap and chill thoroughly before serving.

551,https://veganuary.com/recipes/vegan-chorizo/,Vegan Chorizo,"
Ingredients

Dry ingredients:
1 cup vital wheat gluten
1/4 cup chickpea flour
2 tbsp nutritional yeast
2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp hot chili powder
1/2 tsp turmeric
1/2 tsp white pepper
1 tbsp chilli flakes
4 minced garlic gloves
Wet Ingredients:
2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 tbsp soy sauce
1/4 tsp liquid smoke
1 tbsp tomato paste
1 cup of vegetable stock (you might not need all of this)

","
Method

Add all the dry ingredients to a large bowl and mix well with a fork before making a well in the centre.


Add the cider vinegar, soya sauce, liquid smoke, tomato paste, and a little of the stock. Different brands of wheat gluten need different amounts of stock so be cautious at first. You can always add but you can’t take away.


Mix well with a wooden spoon, adding a little stock as you go until it comes together. You want it to be moist but it requires kneading too so it can’t be too wet. If you add too much stock, you can always add more wheat gluten.


Once it has all come together, knead the dough for 5 minutes. You should start to see some stringy bits forming. That is the gluten developing.


Once you have done that, divide out the dough in to equal portions. This should make 4 but you can do more or less, depending on how big you want them to be.


Roll each piece in to a rough sausage shape and then wrap in tin foil and fold or twist the ends shut. I usually lightly oil the tin foil, just in case they stick. Make sure you go around the sausage a couple of times otherwise they can burst. You don’t have to do it too tightly, the sausage will expand to fill the space.


Once you have them all rolled up, put them in a steamer for 45 mins. If you made lots of thin sausages, 35 – 40 mins should be fine. If you made really large sausages then you want to be more like 55 – 60 mins. I turned mine over halfway through the steaming as well.


Once they have steamed, let them cool without opening the packages. Put them in the fridge where they will become more solid over a few hours. They last a week or two in the fridge if you don’t open them.

120ml/4fl oz soya milk
2 tbsp mild vegetable oil
3 tsp lemon or lime zest
Juice of 1 lemon
Dry Sauce:
150g/5oz light brown sugar
30g/1oz plain white flour
Wet Sauce:
Juice of 2 lemons or 2-3 limes
Boiling water added to juice to make up to 250ml/9fl oz

","
Preparation
Serves 4-5

Use individual ramekins (little oven-proof dishes)

Read the recipe carefully before you start – especially the sauce and lemon juice/hot water part at the end – then get everything weighed out and ready. Now go, you vegan chef…

Method

Preheat oven to 180ºC/350ºF/Gas Mark 4 – you will need to put it on for at least 10 minutes to make sure the oven is properly hot before you mix together the pudding batter. If using a fan-assisted oven, reduce the heat by about 10-15 degrees.
Put kettle on to boil.
Lightly oil 6 oven-proof ramekin dishes (the white ones are usually fine).
In a medium bowl, mix together the dry ingredients.
In a jug or smaller bowl, whisk together the wet batter ingredients then add to the dry batter ingredients and mix well.
Place in the ramekins.
Make the dry sauce by first whisking together the flour and sugar. Sprinkle this DRY mixture quickly and evenly over the batter in each ramekin.
Now very quickly make the wet sauce: mix the lemon/lime juice with the boiling water and pour evenly over each ramekin. Yes, really! DO NOT STIR.
Bake for 20-25 minutes until the tops are golden and the puddings are still slightly gooey inside – test with a toothpick. If using a fan-assisted oven, check after 15 minutes. If too gooey, return to the oven for another 5-10 minutes until done.

556,https://veganuary.com/recipes/creamy-cauliflower-pasta-sauce-five-ways/,Creamy Cauliflower Pasta Sauce – Five Ways,"
Ingredients

1 small cauliflower (approximately 400g/14oz)
1 can (400ml) of organic coconut milk
3 garlic cloves
1 teaspoon sea salt
3 cardamom pods
1 heaped teaspoon ground coriander
Pinch of pepper (optional)

","
Preparation
Make the main sauce:

Chop the cauliflower and cook in a large saucepan (with lid) along with the coconut milk (no water). Bring to the boil and then turn down to a simmer.
Take the cardamom seeds out of the pods and chop them with a knife. Chop or crush them as finely as you can (within reason) to unleash their flavour. Toss in the pan.
Peel and crush the garlic cloves and add to the pan along with the salt. Note: If you are using the oven at the same time, roast the garlic first to really bring out the flavour (it’s not essential at all, but it does add a bit of culinary magic if you can).
Simmer for 20 minutes or until you can easily pierce the cauliflower with a fork. Then blend everything together until creamy, using a jug blender or hand blender.
Pour over pasta or noodles and enjoy.


Method
Alternative version 1: “Roasted Pepper & Garlic Sauce”

Leave out cardamom from the original recipe.
Use 1 sweet pepper and 3 cloves of garlic.
Roast the sweet pepper and garlic in a hot oven… To do this, keep the garlic in its skin and place on an oven tray along with the pepper and place in a pre-heated oven (gas mark 7/425°C/220°F should work fine). Roast garlic for up to 10 minutes and the pepper for about 15-20 minutes (or until the pepper is easy to pierce). No need to let the pepper char.
It’s best to wait until the garlic cools down a little before you pop it out of it’s skin. Gently chop off the top; then squeeze out the fleshy garlic and place in a jug ready to blend with everything else.
Blend in the pepper and garlic with the original recipe and enjoy either creamy smooth or rustic.

Alternative version 2: “Mushroom Sauce”

Sautee 200g of mushrooms and one medium sized onion in coconut oil and then add to the blended sauce for a chunky mushroom sauce or delicious soup.

Alternative version 3: “Scheezy Sauce”

Add two heaped tablespoons of nutritional yeast extract for a scheezy sauce.

Alternative version 4: “Super Easy Stock Cube Sauce”

Leave out the cardamom and sea salt and add a couple of vegan stock cubes for a super easy immediate infusion of flavour.

Alternative version 5: “Totally Coconut Sauce”

Add up to 100g of creamed coconut block or up to 200g of coconut cream to the mix before blending – for a sensational infusion of coconut.

1 small onion, I prefer red onions but any will do
1-2 cloves of garlic, crushed
1-2 chillies, chopped (if you don’t want them spicy, you can leave these out)
1 can of chickpeas, washed and drained
1 can of chopped tomatoes
1-2 teaspoons of vegetable stock powder
3-4 teaspoons of spices (I used turmeric, cumin, garam masala
2 large potatoes, boiled & mashed
100g of quinoa
250ml of water
Gram (chickpea) flour (ordinary flour will do if you don’t have any)
Vegetable oil

","
Method

Sauté off the onions, chillies, and garlic in a glug of the oil.
Add 3 teaspoons of the spices to the mixture and mix well.
Add the chickpeas, chopped tomatoes, 1 teaspoon of vegetable stock powder.
Allow the mixture to simmer for a while until the chickpeas have softened enough to eat then remove from the heat.
In the meantime, cook the quinoa in a rice cooker or flat-bottomed pan with the 250ml of water, remaining vegetable stock, and spices.
Once all the ingredients are cooled, add them to a food processor and blend.  You may need to do this in batches depending on the size of your food processor.  If you do, try to make sure there’s an equal amount of each ingredient in each batch.
Once the mixture has blended, add the flour, a tablespoon at a time and mix, keep going until you reach a consistency that is still fairly moist but firm enough that it will hold its shape when shaped and handled gently.
With some of the flour in a bowl, and begin making the mixture into balls and coating them in the flour before squashing them into burger patty shapes.  How big is up to you – judge it based on the size you want.
Heat up about 2-3 inches of vegetable oil in a wok, to test the temperature is right, drop a small amount of mixture into the pan and if it bubbles, it’s ready to cook the burgers.
Cook the burgers for 5-10 minutes, until a lovely golden brown colour, then transfer them to a plate with some kitchen roll to drain the excess oil.
Serve in burger buns with whatever garnish you fancy and some yummy potato wedges or chips.  I love them with red onions, grated courgette and chilli jam.  Mmmmmm!

Ingredients
For the Crumble
65g plain white flour
65g granulated sugar
55g vegan butter
1 tsp ground cinnamon
Pinch flaky sea salt
For the Cake
1 tsp ground psyllium husks (or 1 tbsp ground flax/linseed) + 4 tsp water
260g plain white flour
2 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp fine sea salt
55g vegan butter, at room temperature
100g granulated sugar
50g light muscovado sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
2 tsp lemon zest
240ml vegan soy yoghurt, unsweetened and unflavoured
200g blueberries (fresh or frozen)
","
Method

Preheat the oven to 190c. Grease a 20x26cm baking dish or cake tin.

To Make the Crumble

Place all the crumble ingredients in a medium bowl. Using a pastry cutter or two knives, chop everything together until you have a lumpy, crumbly texture. If you like your crumble much finer, rub the mixture between your fingertips to break up the lumps of butter. Set aside.

To Make the Cake

In a small bowl mix together the psyllium husks and water. If using ground flax/linseeds instead, use 1 tablespoon of seeds and 2 tablespoons of water instead.
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and fine sea salt. Whisk well to combine. Set aside.
In a separate medium bowl, place the vegan butter. Using a stand mixer or a hand mixer, beat the butter for a minute or until smooth and light. Add the thickened psyllium husks, sugars, vanilla, and lemon zest and beat again to combine. Note that psyllium husks like to clump together, so be sure to beat until smooth.
Alternating between the soy yoghurt and the flour mixture, add a few spoonfuls at a time, beating to combine between each addition. Once fully combined, add the soy milk and beat for a final time. You should now have a thick cake batter.
Add ¾ of the blueberries and very gently fold them into the batter. Transfer the batter to the prepared baking tray or cake tin and spread smooth with the back of a spoon. Top with the remaining blueberries.
Finally, top the cake with the crumble topping and place in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until puffed in the centre and the crumble is browned nicely.
Remove once baked and allow to cool fully on a wire cooling rack before slicing and serving.

Ingredients

1 packet of quinoa
2 cups of carrots (cut into ¼ inch pieces)
4 onions (diced)
8 cloves of garlic (chopped finely)
1 ½ tablespoons of chili powder
½ tablespoon of cumin
1 cup of canned 100% pure pumpkin
2 cans of your favourite beans (pinto, black, kidney), drained
1 ½ – 2 cups of vegetable broth
1 small can of tomato paste
1 can of corn
1-2 spring onions (chopped; optional garnish)
Vegan sour cream

","
Method

First, place a tablespoon of oil into a large pot and a sprinkle of salt; this will prevent sticking. Then, toss in the onion and garlic and cook on medium heat until the onions have softened (approximately 8-10 minutes). Whilst the onions and garlic are softening, cook the quinoa as per the instructions on the packet and set aside for later.
Once the onions have softened and the garlic is fragrant, cover them with the chili powder and cumin and stir in and continue cooking for 2-3 minutes until all of the moisture in the pot has evaporated (if you prefer adding more cumin/chili powder you can do so to your own taste). At this point stir in the tomato paste, broth and carrots, and simmer for 5-6 minutes to amalgamate the flavors.
Once the mixture has been brought to a simmer, stir in the pumpkin, then the beans and bring the chili to a boil. Once at a boil, reduce the heat and stir the beans until covered and cook them until cooked through (10-15 minutes). Once cooked, add the corn and quinoa to the chili last minute to heat through.
 Serve immediately with a small dollop of your favorite vegan sour cream and a few chopped pieces of spring onion.

Ingredients
3 Tbsp. ground flaxseed
200g coconut sugar
2 tsp vanilla essence
120ml melted coconut oil
200g ground almonds
100g desiccated coconut
2 tsp cinnamon
½ tsp nutmeg
50g grated carrot
100g pecan nuts or walnuts, roughly chopped
Dairy-free icing (optional) 
150g unsalted cashew nuts, soaked in boiling water for 30 minutes, or overnight in cold water
60ml agave or maple syrup
2 tbsp coconut oil
1 tsp vanilla extract
Pinch of sea salt
","
Method
First make the flax egg. Mix the 3 Tbsp. ground flaxseed with 9 Tbsp water and beat together. Let sit for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 160 °C/Gas 3. Beat the flax egg mixture, coconut sugar, vanilla and oil until light and well combined. Add the ground almonds, coconut, cinnamon and nutmeg, and stir until just combined. Then add the grated carrot and chopped nuts, and mix until well combined. Line a 23cm spring-form tin with baking paper and spray the sides with non-stick baking spray or oil. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool in the tin for about 10 minutes, then loosen the edges with a knife and remove from the tin to cool. When totally cool, prepare the icing (see below) and spread thickly all over the cake.
To make the icing, drain and rinse the soaked cashew nuts. Combine all the ingredients in a high-speed blender or food processor, and blend until smooth and creamy. You may need to scrape the mixture down and pulse a few times to achieve the desired consistency. Remove from the blender and set aside. Spread over the carrot cake once it has completely cooled.

569,https://veganuary.com/recipes/vegan-sausage-and-mash/,Vegan Sausage and Mash,"
Ingredients

1 x pack of vegan sausages (I chose Dee’s Leek and Onion as they’re lush!)
Enough potatoes to make your own mountain of mash
Broccoli
Veggie gravy (see link in Preparation for recipe)
Salt and cracked pepper
Vegan spread/marge

","
Preparation
Special thanks to Victoria Harley for the image: split-pin.co.uk

You can use gravy granules or make your own. I always make my own and you can find out how in my Vegan Roast Dinner recipe.


Method

If making your own gravy, you probably want to get started on that first. If using granules you can start on that about the same time as the broccoli
Wash and chop your potatoes (I always leave the skins on, even for mash, as there’s so much goodness there!), and add to a pan of water
Bring to boil and then keep on a medium heat until the potatoes are nice and soft
In the meantime, cook the sausages according to the instructions on the packet
Wash and cut your broccoli into florets and add to a pan of hot water. I like my broccoli crunchy and bright green so I only cook mine in boiling water for a few minutes before draining and serving
Drain your potatoes and mash with a little vegan marge, a little salt and heaps of cracked pepper
Plate up, pour over gravy and eat immediately!

570,https://veganuary.com/recipes/banana-breakfast-muffins/,Banana Breakfast Muffins,"
Ingredients

5.2 oz (150g, 80ml) melted coconut oil (can also use vegetable/sunflower or other mild oils)
1tsp vanilla extract
1 1/4 cup (5.7oz, 150g) wholewheat flour
3/4 cup (3.5 oz, 100g) self-raising flour
1tsp baking powder
½ cup (3.5oz, 100g) granulated sugar
1/2 cup (100ml) of your preferred plant-based milk
2 flax “eggs” (2tbsp ground flax mixed with 6tbsp water)
3 ripe medium bananas

","
Preparation
Pre-heat the oven to 350f / 185c / Gas Mark 5

Method
Mix up the two flax “eggs” by adding the ground flax to the water and set to one side.
Combine the wholewheat flour, self-raising flour, baking powder and granulated sugar in a bowl.
Mash the bananas and to this add your plant-based milk of choice oil, vanilla and two flax “eggs”. Stir well to combine all of the ingredients.
Make a well in the centre of your dry ingredients, add the wet and mix together until they are just to say combined. Don’t over-mix as you will rid the batter of air and give it less of a rise when baking.
Spoon your mixture into the muffin cases and bake for 18-22 minutes.
Before putting them into the oven, you might like to sprinkle a little more ground flax over the top but it’s not essential.
You will know they’re done when you insert a toothpick and it comes out dry. Once there is no batter on the toothpick, remove from the oven as over-baking will lead to dried out muffins.
These will keep for 3-4 days in an airtight container or you can individually freeze them once completely cooled. Individual freezing is a great method for those who struggle to make time for breakfast as you can take one out of the freezer and place it into the fridge the day before and it’s ready to grab the next morning.

571,https://veganuary.com/recipes/homemade-vegan-gravy/,Homemade Vegan Gravy,"
Ingredients

Splash of olive oil 
2 large carrots, diced
2 sticks of celery, diced
1 medium red onion, diced
2 garlic cloves, crushed or minced
1 teaspoon of dried thyme
1 tablespoon of maple syrup, agave, or sugar
2-3 teaspoons of yeast extract – add according to your preference
2 tablespoons of plain flour (if you have an allergy, corn flour, gram flour or your preferred flour for thickening will do)
3 tablespoons of red wine (or you can use 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar)
2 teaspoons of vegetable bouillon powder
2 teaspoons of tomato paste or puree (or ketchup in a pinch)
900ml of cold water

","
Preparation
Serves 4

Method

Heat the oil in a large flat-bottomed pan, then add the celery, onion, and carrots
Once the veg has started to soften, add the garlic, turning the heat to medium
Once the garlic is beginning to cook, but before it goes brown, add the maple syrup/sugar and stir, ensuring all ingredients are well coated
Allow to simmer for a minute or so, until the vegetables begin to caramelise
Add the yeast extract and mix again to ensure even coating
If at any point you find the pan is browning, add a small splash of water to prevent burning
Add the flour & vegetable bouillon, stir to make sure everything is coated evenly
Add the wine or balsamic vinegar and mix well
Once the wine/vinegar has heated up, add the water, stirring continually as you do
Bring to the boil, stirring regularly
Stir in the tomato puree
Allow to simmer for 15 minutes or so, until the mixture thickens and the gravy reduces to your desired consistency
Once you’ve achieved your desired consistency and flavour, sieve into a fresh pan and warm just before you serve the remainder of your meal

Tips: 

If you don’t have yeast extract, you can try substituting with nutritional yeast and/or soy sauce
For a bit of variety, try adding different herbs, such as sage, or bay leaves
Try adding mushrooms or a little chopped beetroot when you’re adding the veg for a slightly more earthy flavour, the beetroot also gives the gravy a lovely deep colour to it
If you want to get all the flavour when sieving, feel free to pour a little freshly boiled water over the remaining mixture, then reduce down as needed

Preparation
Makes 8.
Preheat the oven to 180C.

Method

Cream the sugar and margarine together in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the puréed chickpea followed by the flax eggs until well combined (though don’t worry if it separates slightly once you add the flax, that’s fine).


Next sieve in the flour, folding it in as you go. Finally stir in the chopped chocolate.


Grease a deep tin or oven-proof dish (glass or ceramic are fine) and pour the mixture in, spreading evenly. Place in the oven and bake for around 45 minutes; the exact cooking time will depend on your oven.


Once cooked, remove from the oven and leave to cool for around five minutes. After this time you can slice the blondies and move to a wire cooling rack or kitchen roll to cool fully.


To prepare the topping, melt the chocolate in a bain-marie (a glass bowl over a pan of shallow boiling water), stirring until it is smooth and glossy. Using a fork, drizzle the melted chocolate over the blondies and leave to set.

Preparation
tibits at home: stylish vegetarian cuisine is a sumptuous cookbook, split into four seasonal sections, containing 50 recipes that will delight all loyal tibits fans, as well as those who are new to the brand. 80 per cent of tibits’ menu is vegan and many of the recipes in the book are also vegan – good news for the rapidly increasing number of vegans in the UK.

Method

Wash the beans and cut into 4 cm pieces. Cook in saltwater until tender. Then drain and rinse immediately under cold running water.
Wash the courgettes and cut into 2 cm dice. Wash the red pepper, remove the seeds and cut into 2 cm dice. Clean the mushrooms, remove any traces of soil and cut the ends.
Heat the peanut oil and sweat the red pepper, mushrooms and courgettes for 3-4 minutes. Drain in a sieve.
Meanwhile mix the coconut milk with the vegetable stock and the curry paste and bring to the boil.

4tsp cocoa powder
200ml water
200ml amaretto
1 cinnamon stick
2 star anise
4 ripe pears, peeled
4tbsp vegan cream cheese
Seeds from 1 vanilla pod
","
Method
Heat your oven to 180c/390f/GM4.
In a food processor or the chopper attachment of a hand blender, grind the pecans until they are crumbs. Mix in the ground almonds, sea salt, maple syrup and cocoa powder. Place this on a baking tray, bake for 10-12 minutes until it has dried out but do not let it burn. If the crumb has clumped together press it with a fork so it is in small pieces.
Put the water, amaretto, cinnamon stick, star anise and pears in a saucepan with a lid. Boil for 8-15 minutes until the pears are cooked through. Test this by using a sharp knife rather than a fork which will leave an unsightly mark on the pears.
Mix the cream cheese with the vanilla seeds.
To serve, plate the chocolate nut crumb first, add a pear to each plate and spoonful of vanilla cream cheese on the side and drizzle the hot amaretto water on the pear.
 
TIPS
Cut the bottom of the pears flat so they will stay upright when plated.
If you want to increase the sweetness in the dish you can serve it with a small pot of maple syrup.

Ingredients
For the sponge:
150g Aquafaba
¼ tsp cream of tartar
90ml plant milk (I use soya)
1tbs apple cider vinegar
160g Plain flour
190g caster sugar
40g cocoa powder
½ tsp salt
½ tsp baking powder
¼ tsp baking soda
75ml vegetable oil
Icing sugar for dusting
For the whipped ganache filling:
100g Rhythm 108 vegan hazelnut truffle bar
75ml vegan pouring cream
","
Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180c fan. Grease and line a baking tray (roughly 33 x 25cm) with parchment paper.
2. Pour the aquafaba and the cream of tartar into the bowl of a stand mixer and mix on medium high speed until stiff peaks are formed. This means the aquafaba doesn’t move even when tipped upside down.
3. Meanwhile, place the plant milk into the microwave for 1 minute to warm through, this can also be done in a pan over a medium heat on the hob. Add in the apple cider vinegar and stir, place to the side.
4. In a large mixing bowl, add the plain flour, caster sugar, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Mix with a whisk until fully combined.
5. Add the oil and the milk/apple cider vinegar mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until fully combined. The mixture will be very stiff and dry at this point but that’s normal.
6. Gently fold the aquafaba into the mixture one spoon at a time, trying not to knock too much air out. It will become a much looser mixture as you add more aquafaba.
7. Pour the mixture into the lined baking tray, and level out the top until smooth.
8. Place in the oven for 12-15mins, until a skewer comes out clean. Whilst the sponge is baking, lay out a piece of parchment paper the size of the sponge and cover with a light sprinkle of caster sugar.
9. Once the sponge is fully baked, tip it out top side down onto the parchment covered in sugar. Peel off the parchment paper on the bottom of the sponge.
10. Use a sharp knife to make an incision an inch into the short side of the sponge, being carefully to only cut half way into the sponge and not the full way through (this just makes it easier to roll).
11. Carefully roll up the sponge with the parchment still inside (this stops it from sticking together) and leave to cool rolled up.
12. Meanwhile, for the filling, warm the cream until it is steaming (either 1-2minutes in the microwave or over a medium heat on the hob). Once the cream is steaming hot, break up your Rhythm 108 hazelnut truffle bar into chunks and place into the cream. Leave to stand for 1 minute, then stir until a glossy mixture is formed, with no lumps of chocolate.
13. Place this in the fridge to set. Once the ganache has hardened, place into a large mixing bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer and whip up on medium high until you get a light and fluffy filling.
14. Once the sponge is cool, unroll carefully, then fill with the whipped ganache, spreading out evenly over the sponge.
15. Gently roll back up to form your perfect swiss roll! Don’t panic if there are a few cracks…it looks just as perfect. You can finish by cutting off the edges and dusting lightly with icing sugar!

Ingredients

5 Portobello mushrooms, de-stemmed (save stems for another recipe)
2–3 Tbsp everyday olive oil
2 Tbsp vegan butter
Shawarma Blend:
1 Tbsp cumin
1 Tbsp paprika
1/2 tsp cayenne
2 tsp cinnamon
1 Tbsp granulated onion
2 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp Sea salt
Fresh cracked Pepper
(optional: 1 Tbsp dried ginger)
Tzatziki:
1 cup plain yoghurt (Kite Hill)
2 Tbsp mint, finely chopped
1–2 garlic clove, crushed and finely chopped
1–2 Tbsp lemon zest
Pinch of salt
All the fixins:
Cucumber, thinly sliced
Cherry tomatoes halved
Parsley
Arugula (rocket)
Warm pitta breads
Harissa Sauce

","
Method

Get a pan ripping hot and add a little oil. Place mushrooms, stem facing down, on a baking sheet and drizzle with oil. Place mushrooms, stem facing up, onto the hot pan, and add another pan on top for the pressing step.
Allow the weight of the pan to press them gently and apply gentle pressure using a tea towel once softened (you want them to soften, before properly pressing them, otherwise they break). As soon as you start to see water being released, start to apply more pressure. Turn and press on the other side, until they are half the size of the raw mushroom. (The whole pressing process will take between 8-10 minutes). Repeat for remaining mushrooms until caramelized on edges.
Combine all spices and seasonings in a small bowl and coat the stem side of the mushroom with the blend. Flip over and repeat, coating with the spices. Use a spoon to push the seasoning into the surface of the mushrooms.
Heat up a pan on medium heat and coat surface liberally with vegan butter. Saute mushrooms in a pan and blacken on both sides.
Make Tzatziki; Mix plain yoghurt, mint, garlic clove (crushed and finely chopped), lemon zest, and salt in a bowl.
Prep your side vegetables, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and fresh parsley
Remove mushrooms from the pan and chop into thin slices, reminiscent of kebab meat.
Warm pitta bread in the oven and wrap in a tea towel, assemble your shawarma on a plate, topped with Tzatziki, arugula, mushrooms, tomatoes, sliced cucumber, parsley, and harissa.
Serve and enjoy!

Ingredients

480ml almond milk 
140g pecans, soaked for 2 hours 
120ml maple syrup 
100ml brown rice syrup 
2 teaspoons vanilla extract (or scrape out 1 vanilla pod) 
80g cacao powder  
3 tablespoons coconut oil 
For the topping:
3 tablespoons toasted almonds, crushed 
a handful of sliced seasonal fruits

","
Preparation
Serves 4 -6.

Method

Place all the ingredients in a blender except the coconut oil and blitz together until very smooth. Warm the coconut oil in a small pan until it just melts, and drizzle it into the blender while the blades are running. Check that the mixture is sweet enough and blend for a couple of minutes until light and smooth.


Sieve the ice cream mix into a thick glass baking dish and cover with clingfilm. Pop it into the freezer. Once it is frozen, take the ice cream out of the freezer and leave it for 20 minutes until it is just starting to soften. Then place it in the large bowl of a food processor and whiz until the mixture becomes smooth and light. Don’t whiz for too long, though, otherwise it will turn back to liquid. Put the ice cream back into the freezer immediately and leave for 3 to 4 hours.


This ice cream will be very hard straight from the freezer, so take it out at least 20 minutes before serving.


Serve topped with crushed nuts and/or sliced fruits. Drizzling over some almond cream or chocolate sauce makes a real sundae of it.

Ingredients

Cooked rice/quinoa
Sweet potato
Broccoli
Kale
Beans – black or black-eyed are good!
Carrots
Garlic
Olive and sesame oil
Spices! Smoked paprika, turmeric, salt, pepper
The juice of one lemon
Soy and hot sauce

","
Preparation
Top tip! If you don’t already own it then you must go and buy Isa Does It by Isa Chandra Moskowitz, as she has an entire section on bowl food and every recipe is just wonderful. And quick! Her recipes have literally changed my life.
I haven’t included amounts here as you’re basically making to serve, so enough kale for however many people etc. etc.


Method

Cut up your sweet potato into small chunks and coat with a little olive oil, smoked paprika, turmeric, salt and pepper. Roast for about 30 minutes.
Add 1 cup of rice to cold water, bring to boil, turn down and simmer for 30 minutes. If you want to add extra protein then use quinoa instead of rice.
That’s the most complicated part of the cooking done!
Prepare your veg…
Crush and dice your garlic.
Chop up your broccoli into florets.
Grate your carrot.
Wash your kale and beans.
When it looks like the rice and sweet potato is about 10 minutes off being ready, start cooking the veg!
Put the broccoli in a pan with cold water and on a medium high heat with the lid on. You want to cook your broc until the water is just boiling and then tip out into a colander. Crunchy broccoli is where it’s at!
Add the garlic to a heavy bottom pan with a little oil (only a touch) and get it sizzling. After about 1 minute add your kale.
Once the kale is wilting slightly, add the carrot and then the beans. Mix up well.
Squeeze over the juice of one lemon and add a dash of sesame oil and the soy sauce. Mix well.
Once the beans are warmed through you’re ready to serve. Your broccoli should be bubbling by now too, or thereabouts.
Take out the sweet potato from the oven and get the hummus out of the fridge (I make my own).
Now bowl up…  Add a good serving spoon of rice per bowl, and then dish the veg around it.  Finish with a big dollop of hummus on the top!
Season with pepper and hot sauce, and take the hummus and soy with you to the table in case you want to add extra flavour.
Enjoy!

Ingredients

1 butternut squash
Smoked paprika
1 bag of spinach
Cherry tomatoes
Kalamata olives
Cucumber
Celery
1 red pepper
Sunflower seeds
Extra virgin olive oil
Balsamic vinegar
Salt and cracked pepper

","
Preparation
Special thanks to Victoria Harley for the image: split-pin.co.uk

Method

Cut your butternut squash into 2/3cm chunks and pour into a roasting tin.
Add a small glug of olive oil, smoked paprika, a little salt and cracked pepper. Mix well.
Put into the oven at 220C for about 30 minutes (cook until soft and slightly caramelised).
In the meantime make your salad… Wash and cut your veg (no need to cut up the spinach unless you have really large leaves, then it is better to tear rather than use a knife) and add to the bowl.
Add all the smaller veggies first and then mix in handfuls of the spinach leaves at a time, so everything is evenly mixed.
Into a fry pan, pour out some sunflower seeds. More is more here, so don’t scrimp. You want at least half a cup of seeds.
Dry fry the seeds on a medium heat until they are turning golden on both sides, stir a lot with a wooden or heat resistant spoon. Take care not to let them burn. Set aside to cool.
When the squash is ready, remove from oven and allow to cool for a minute or so, before spooning on top of the salad mix.
Then add the toasted seeds.
Shake some olive oil over the top, about the same and a half of balsamic vinegar and some cracked pepper.
Mix slightly, but make sure the squash and seeds are still visible on the top.
Serve!

596,https://veganuary.com/recipes/banana-coconut-cake/,Banana and Coconut Cake,"
Ingredients
For the cake:

250g / 9 oz plain flour (wheat, spelt or gluten-free)
3 level teaspoons baking powder
100g / 3½ oz fairtrade light brown or golden sugar
75g / 2½ oz desiccated coconut
4 medium to large over-ripe fairtrade bananas
150ml / 5.1 fl oz plant milk of your choice, e.g. soya, rice or oat milk
100ml / 3.4 fl oz / sunflower oil
1 tablespoon golden syrup or rice syrup
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

For the topping:

200g / 7 oz creamed coconut (1 block)
200ml / 6.8 fl oz canned coconut milk
1 tablespoon agave nectar
50g / 2 oz desiccated coconut

","
Method

Preheat your oven to 180ºC/350ºF/Gas Mark 4 and grease an 8” round cake tin.
Sieve together the flour, baking powder and sugar. Gently stir in the desiccated coconut.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the plant milk, sunflower oil, syrup and vanilla extract.
Peel and chop the bananas then mash well until there are no lumps remaining or purée them in a blender. Whisk the liquid mixture into the banana purée.
Make a well in the bowl of dry ingredients and fold in the wet banana mixture a little at a time.
Pour into the prepared cake tin and bake in the pre-heated oven for about 45 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Cover the cake with foil if it begins to brown too much during baking.
Remove from the oven and leave in the tin to set for 10-15 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
To make the topping, chop the block of creamed coconut into small pieces. Melt it in a double boiler by placing a bowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn’t touch the water.
Meanwhile, pour the coconut milk into a large bowl and whisk well until smooth or use a blender. If you’re using a 400ml can, whisk or blend the coconut milk before measuring out your 200ml. Stir in the agave nectar and desiccated coconut, then whisk in the melted coconut cream.
Put the topping in the fridge to set a little until it becomes stiff enough to spread on top of the cooled cake.
Decorate with slices of firm banana, which have been brushed with lemon juice to prevent them browning, and toasted coconut shreds or chopped nuts.
Keep refrigerated – if it’s not gobbled up straight away!

597,https://veganuary.com/recipes/salted-caramel-peanut-butter-truffles/,Salted Caramel Peanut Butter Truffles,"
Ingredients

1 pound or 1 1/2 cups (packed) pitted dates
2.5 tablespoons of melted coconut oil 
3/4 teaspoons of sea salt
1/4 cup salted peanut butter 
1 heaped cup vegan chocolate chips (or other vegan chocolate)

","
Preparation
This recipe makes about 16 Truffles – this will vary according to the size of the Truffles made. 

Method

Put the dates and 1 tablespoon of melted coconut oil in the blender and mix. If it’s not quite combining, drizzle in warm water a little at a time (about 1 teaspoon), scrape down sides and blend until a rough paste or ball forms – if you add too much water it will be difficult to handle them later as they won’t freeze up well
Add the sea salt and blend again, then freeze for 10 – 15 minutes
Create small balls of the mix in  your hands. Put them on a baking tray which has been lined with greaseproof paper and put them back in the freezer while you do the next step
Put the peanut butter and 1/2 a tablespoon of coconut oil in a bowl or pan and melt it on the cooker or in a microwave
Drizzle the warmed peanut butter on the truffles and freeze for about 10 – 15 minutes
Put the chocolate chips and remaining 1 tablespoon of coconut oil in a pan or bowl and melt it
Remove truffles from freezer and, use a fork to scoop truffles in to the pan/bowl, so that it’s coated in chocolate, then hold it above the pan/bowl to ensure that any excess drips off, before putting it on the greaseproof paper again
Put them back in freezer to set, the dust them with cocoa powder to serve

Serving: Serve the truffles straight from the freezer, but if they’ve been in the freezer for a day or longer, take out the number that you are going eat and allow them to soften for about 10 – 15 minutes, before biting into them.
Storage: They can be stored in the freezer for at least 2 weeks.
Optional: Sprinkle a small amount of sea salt on the truffles before freezing them for the final time
Variations: The next time I made these I put them in disposable cupcake cases, which was easier and neater. I’ve now purchased reusable cupcake cases to do this in the future.

599,https://veganuary.com/recipes/fudgy-beetroot-brownies/,Fudgy Beetroot Brownies,"
Ingredients
For the brownies:

4 fresh beetroot, peeled, chopped, boiled until softened (retain a small amount of the liquid from cooking), and puréed in a food processor
100g plain flour
50g dairy-free margarine
50g brown sugar
3 flax “eggs” (1tbsp ground flax meal + 3tbsp water per “egg”, whisked for five minutes)
125g dark chocolate, roughly chopped
3tbsp cocoa powder
2tsbp liquid coffee
2tsp baking powder

For the topping:

50g dark chocolate, broken into pieces
2tsp coconut oil
1tbsp water from the beetroot
¼tsp stevia syrup (optional)
Small amount of desiccated coconut or grated dark chocolate to sprinkle on top (optional)

","
Preparation
Serves 8.
Preheat the oven to 180C.

Method

In a large mixing bowl, cream the margarine and sugar. Once mixed, stir in the flax eggs followed by the beetroot purée and coffee.


In another bowl, add the flour, cocoa and baking powder. Using a sieve to remove any lumps, slowly add the flour mix to the beetroot mix, a small amount at a time. As you go, gently fold in the flour, avoiding stirring too much. Finally, stir in the chopped chocolate.


Grease a deep tin or oven-proof dish (glass or ceramic are fine) and pour the mixture in, spreading evenly. Place in the oven and bake for around 45 minutes; the exact cooking time will depend on your oven. For fudgy brownies, you can tell they are cooked when the edges begin to pull away from the container and putting a cocktail stick in doesn’t bring out any lumps (it won’t come out clean for fudgy ones even when they are cooked).


Once the brownies are cooked, remove from the oven. Leave for around five minutes to cool slightly before transferring to a cooling rack or kitchen paper. Allow them to cool completely before adding the topping.


Whilst the brownies are cooling, bring a small amount of water to the boil in a large pan. Place a large heat-proof mixing bowl over the pan and add the chocolate, coconut oil, and beetroot water into the bowl. Stir constantly until the ingredients have melted and formed a smooth, glossy paste. Mix in the stevia syrup, if using.


Spread the topping evenly over each brownie and sprinkle with either desiccated coconut or grated chocolate. Serve as warm or cold!

4 cloves of garlic
2 medium sized onions
2-3 cups of mixed vegetables, we used courgettes, squash, carrots and tomatoes
200g of firm tofu (optional)
1 tbsp of smoked paprika
1 tbsp of vegan stock
For the vinaigrette:
4 tomatoes
Salt and pepper
Handful of herbs (such as parsley, basil, as you prefer)
Olive oil
Juice of 1 lime
1 red onion
For the Farofa:
200g Farofa flour (usually found in South America or West African supermarkets)
1 clove of garlic chopped finely
1 small onion chopped finely
To Garnish:
1 orange, cut into segments
1 spring onion
","
Method

Fry the onions and garlic in oil in a big pan for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, and then add the chopped vegetables.


After a couple of minutes, add the black beans still in their cooking liquid, stock, and paprika. Leave to cook for 10 minutes. Check the feijoada occasionally to make sure all the liquid hasn’t evaporated, and to give it a quick stir.


Add the tofu cubes if using, and cook for a further 5 minutes. Be careful not to stir too much at this point, otherwise the tofu cubes can break up.


While the tofu is cooking (in the feijoada) you can make the farofa. Put the onion and garlic in hot oil. When the onion and garlic are golden, add the farofa flour and cook for approximately 5 minutes, mixing all the time.


To serve put a few spoonfuls of feijoada on a plate, cover with finely chopped spring onions and the farofa. Serve with some of the vinaigrette and orange segments. Traditionally feijoada is also served with rice.

Preheat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius and line a heart-shaped tin with oil and baking paper – if you have two of the same tins line them both!
Combine all of the dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk to combine.
Do the same with the wet ingredients then pour this into the dry mixture, fold to combine.
Pour half into the lined cake tin (or divide between 2 tins) and bake for 25 minutes or until just golden and a skewer inserted comes out clean. Repeat with the other half of the mixture. Allow both cakes to cool fully.
Use an electric mixer to beat together the vegan butter, until smooth and light.
Spread some of the butter cream on top of one of the cakes, then spread a few tbsp of the chia seed jam on top of that. Place the second cake on top with the flat bottom side on top. Use the buttercream to coat the top and sides of the cakes evenly, you may not need it all.
Place into the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up before decorating with berries etc! Enjoy with someone you love!

8 tbsp water
2 tbsp flax seeds
1 tsp vanilla extract (or fresh vanilla seeds)
2 tbsp agave nectar
Zest of one orange
Juice of half an orange
½ tsp cayenne pepper
2 tsp baking powder
4 tbsp cocoa powder
2 tbsp cacao nibs
Himalayan pink salt to taste

","
Method

Heat the oven to 180°C / 350°F / Gas Mark 4.
Put the coconut oil into a ramekin and put this in the oven for 5 minutes, to melt.
Drain and thoroughly rinse the beans and put them into a mixing bowl. Add the dates. Combine the flax seeds with the water in a small bowl then add this as well.
Use an electronic hand blender or processor to combine the ingredients you have in the mixing bowl.
Dab a little of the cooled coconut oil into each muffin ‘hole’ to prevent the brownie mix from sticking (I do this by hand to avoid wasting any, but you could use a pastry brush). Add the remaining oil to the mixing bowl.
Stir in the remaining ingredients, except the salt.
Use a teaspoon and spatula to put an equal amount of the brownie mixture into each hole of the muffin tray, smooth the top down, and sprinkle a little salt on each.
Cook for 20 minutes. Once cooled, store in the fridge.

613,https://veganuary.com/recipes/pear-and-coconut-crumble/,Pear and Coconut Crumble,"
Ingredients

4-6 large, ripe pears
6 tbsp coconut oil (or margarine)
10 tbsp coconut sugar (or other unrefined sugar) or maple syrup
Juice of half a lemon  
2 cups coconut cream
Dusting of ground ginger
Crumble:
1/3 cup solid coconut oil (or margarine, but coconut is better)
½ cup coconut sugar (or other unrefined sugar)
2 cups jumbo oats
1/3 cup desiccated coconut
½ cup 80% dark chocolate, broken into pieces (ginger chocolate is especially good!)

","
Method
Preheat the oven to 350F/180C. Peel the pears, cut in half, and remove the stalks and seeds. Drizzle with lemon juice to stop browning.
Melt coconut oil (or margarine) in a pan, and add the pear halves. Add the sugar, and allow to caramelise.
After about fifteen minutes, add the coconut cream. Place the contents into a casserole dish. It will look like there’s too much liquid, but don’t worry, as it will be absorbed by the crumble.
Make the crumble: I prefer not to use flour in my crumble as I’m gluten free, but if you’d like it, use about 80g flour, and half the amount of oats. Rub the oil or margarine into the oats. Add the sugar and desiccated coconut. Add the pieces of chocolate and mix well. Place the mixture onto the top of the pears. Bake for 45 minutes.
Serve with soya cream or soya ice cream.

2 tbsp Lemon juice
2 tbsp Nutritional yeast
1 1/2 tsp Salt
1/2 tsp Onion granules
1/4 tsp Ground nutmeg
Mushroom and Chestnut Pâté:
500g Mushrooms (I used chestnut mushrooms)
100g Chestnuts
250g Firm tofu
2 Shallots
3 Cloves of garlic
1/2 tsp Nutritional yeast
1/4 tsp Peppercorns
1/2 tsp Salt
1 tsp Chopped or dried herbs such as sage or thyme
3 tbsp Mushroom Ketchup (optional)
1 tbsp Lemon juice
Flax Seed Crackers:
300g Flax seeds (you can used half golden and half brown if you have them)
30g Sunflower Seeds
200ml Water
1/2 tsp Salt
A small bunch of cavolo nero

","
Preparation
Individually these recipes are pretty simple and easy but it is a bit of work making them all. However, I find there’s plenty of time around Christmas to spend a few hours in the kitchen and these recipes will make enough to keep you and your family going over the festive period.
The flax seed crackers recipe makes about 30 crackers, 15 plain and 15 flavoured. I used cavolo nero but you can use any leafy greens or even sun-dried tomatoes, or whatever you fancy to flavour them.

Method
Cashew Nut Cheese

Place the cashews in a glass bowl and cover with water, leave them to soak for at least 2 hours or leave them overnight.
Drain the cashews, blend them with 250ml water, the nutritional yeast, salt and lemon juice. If your nutritional yeast flakes are quite large you might want to put them in the blender first to break them down so they are nice and small. Keep blending the mix until you get a nice creamy paste.
Stir in the onion granules and nutmeg.
Pour the mixture into a tin or bowl and leave it at room temperature, covered for 12 hours.
Put the mixture into the fridge and leave to chill for at least 2 hours.

Mushroom and Chestnut Pâté

Cut a cross in the shell of each chestnut and roast them on a baking tray for 30 minutes at 170C.
Place your block of tofu on a flat surface between two folded sheets of kitchen paper and place something heavy on top to press out the water.
Whilst the chestnuts are roasting, sauté the onion and garlic in a large frying pan until soft. Roughly chop the mushrooms and add them to the pan, cooking them for 10-15 minutes until all the liquid has evaporated.
Stir in the crushed peppercorns, salt, herbs and mushroom ketchup. Cook for another few minutes until the ketchup has reduced down, then set aside to cool.
Once the chestnuts are roasted, take them out of the oven and leave them to cool before shelling them.
Put the chestnuts into a blender and blitz until roughly chopped. Add the cooled mushroom mixture, tofu, nutritional yeast and lemon juice. Blend to a fairly smooth paste.
Spoon the mixture into a springform tin or lined loaf tin and press down firmly. Chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.

Flax Seed Crackers

Grind half the flax seeds with the sunflower seeds in a blender or spice grinder.
Mix together the ground seeds with the whole flax seeds, salt and water.
Put half this mixture into a blender with the cavolo nero.
Line two baking trays with baking paper and spoon out the two mixtures on the trays and press down firmly with the back of a spoon.
Score the mixture into small squares and bake at 170C for 30 mins or until the begin to crisp slightly and aren’t too chewy inside. (If you have a dehydrator, even better!)
Lift the baking paper and crackers out of the trays and place on a wire rack, serve once cooled.

For the Coulibiac:
400g Brussels sprouts [14 oz]
2 handfuls fresh cranberries
200g vacuum packed chestnuts [7 oz]
75g basmati & wild rice [2.6 oz]
3 large banana (echallion) shallots (finely chopped)
2 large garlic cloves (crushed)
2 Tbsp light brown sugar
2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
2 large handfuls of chopped parsley leaves
1 vegan puff pastry (I used Jus Rol) + melted dairy free butter to seal
For the Porcini Mushroom Sauce:

1 small onion (finely chopped)
1 large garlic clove (crushed)
2 Tbsp fresh rosemary leaves (chopped)
500ml vegetable stock [just under 1/2 pint / US 2 cups]
125ml (vegan) white wine [4 fl oz / US 1 cup]
1 Tbsp dairy free butter
1 Tbsp plain flour
3 Tbsp dairy free cream
Salt & pepper
Olive oil

","
Preparation
The only piece of equipment  you need for the top is a Lattice Pastry Cutter. If you do not have one just cover the top with a regular sheet of pastry leaving a little hole in the middle so the steam can escape.

Method

Put porcini mushrooms in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Set aside.
Cook the rice according to packet instructions. It should still have a bit of a bite. Drain and set aside.
In the meantime, heat some olive oil in a large frying pan. Add banana shallots and 2 crushed garlic cloves. Fry gently until golden and soft.
Clean Brussels sprouts. Cut them in thin slices.
Add Brussels sprouts to frying pan with cranberries, balsamic vinegar and sugar. Mix well and cook together for 10 mins.
Add chopped chestnuts. Cook together for 5-10 mins until sprouts and cranberries are cooked. Season to taste.
Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/Gas 6.
Roll out puff pastry to a rectangle of about 33 x 44 cm (13 x 17 inch). Cut pastry to obtain two rectangles of different widths. One should be about 19 x 44 cm (7.5 x 17 inch) and the other 14 x 44 cm (5.5 x 17 inch).
Cover a baking tray with some parchment paper. Please large piece of pastry on top.
Blend vegetables and rice together and pile the mixture on top of pastry leaving a 3 cm (just over 1 inch) edge all around. Brush the edges with some melted dairy free butter.
Run the lattice pastry cutter in the middle of the smaller piece of pastry leaving an edge of around 3 cm (just over 1 inch). Carefully place on top of the vegetable/ rice mixture. The lattice will open as it goes over the filling. Press edges together to seal, folding pastry if necessary.
Brush melted dairy free butter on the lattice and place in the oven for around 20 mins until golden.
In the meantime make the porcini mushroom sauce. Heat some olive oil in a saucepan. Fry onion, garlic and rosemary until soft.
Add porcini mushrooms with their liquid, vegetable stock and wine. Boil together until liquid has reduced by half.
Put flour in a bowl and dilute with some of the liquid from the mushroom sauce, making sure there are no lumps.
Add butter and diluted flour to the mushroom sauce. Whisk regularly and cook under high heat until it has thickened. Blend cream in just before serving. Season to taste.
Serve coulibiac with porcini mushroom sauce on the side.

Ingredients

Step 1 ingredients:
Plenty of cooking oil
Sushi sheets
Step 2 ingredients:
250g extra firm tofu
150g artichoke hearts in oil
Juice of 1/2 lemon
Step 3 ingredients:
80g chickpea flour
5 tbsp nutritional yeast
(2 tbsp olive oil)
1 1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp garlic powder
Step 4 ingredients:
Breadcrumbs (e.g. gluten-free ones)
Optional ingredients:
Lemons
Peas
Ketchup
vegan Mayo
Potatoes salad
Chips

","
Method
Step 1:
Pour cooking oil into a pan and add 1 pack of sushi nori sheets to infuse the oil. The longer you leave them in the better: e.g. you could soak them in the morning and then cook the vegan fish fingers in the evening for a more intense taste. Alternatively, if you don’t have much time heat them up a bit for 5 minutes so they give up more flavour. Make sure the heat isn’t too high because they burn easily.
Step 2:
Place ingredients of step 2 into a food processor until you get a semi-smooth mixture.
Step 3:
Transfer the mixture into a large bowl and add all other ingredients from this step and mix. Make sure there are no chickpea flour lumps, otherwise the fish fingers might taste bitter.
Form fish finger shapes. Alternatively, just form sausage shapes. Admittedly it was a bit of work to make rectangular shapes and when they were fried they lost their shape a bit anyway. So if you want to make your life easier, roll them into a sausage shape, it won’t make a difference in terms of taste. They will be quite soft at this stage, but don’ worry they will firm up when fried.
Step 4:
Add breadcrumbs to a bowl and roll the vegan fish fingers in them until they are covered on all sides.
Take the sushi sheets out of the pan with cooking oil and heat up the pan. Fry the fish fingers in the pan until they are golden brown. Place on a kitchen towel to soak up the excess oil.
Optionally drizzle some lemon juice on top when serving the fish fingers. Have cooked peas, chips or potato salad and ketchup or vegan mayo on the side. Enjoy!

·         600g potatoes (I like to use Rooster potatoes)
·         To season: black pepper, nutritional yeast

","
Preparation
Serves 4.
Preheat the oven to 220°C / 425°F / Gas Mark 7.
I use an enamel cast-iron casserole dish for this recipe, however you could just as easily prepare the sauce in a pan on the hob and transfer to an oven dish for baking.
Puy lentils also go by the name of ‘Lentilles Vertes’ and can be found tinned, dried or vacuum packed in most supermarkets.

Method

Place a heavy-based casserole dish on the hob and heat the oil on a moderate to high heat. Chop the onion, garlic, mushrooms, carrot and rosemary leaves and add these to the oil, stirring.


Leave to sauté for 5 minutes, or until the onions soften.


Stir in the chilli flakes, smoked paprika, cinnamon, coriander seeds and pumpkin seeds, followed by the red wine, vinegar, tamari, tomato purée, chopped tomatoes and water. Simmer for 10 minutes.


While this is bubbling away, slice the potatoes as thinly as you can.


Now add the lentils, spinach and black pepper to the sauce and give it a good stir. Remove from the heat and arrange the potato slices to cover the dish in any pattern you like. If you are using nutritional yeast, sprinkle onto the potato topping.


Cover the dish and cook in the oven for 20 minutes.


Remove the lid and return to the oven for a further 20 minutes. The potatoes should be cooked through and nicely crisp.


Serve with lovely steamed greens or a fresh salad.

Take one-fifth off the pastry and set aside, this is for the lid.
Knead remaining pastry on a floured work surface, roll into a large circle then press into cake tin and droop over the sides of tin, trim leaving a 1 inch border. Any tears in the pastry can easily be pressed back together.
Spoon in half the pie filling then add the dried cranberries evenly on top, finish with the rest of the mixture, pressing down.
Roll out the pastry lid, place on top and fold the pastry from the sides on to pie lid, crimp together. (There should be an inch wall for the cranberries to sit in)Make a slit in the middle of the pie to let steam out. Brush with any plant milk.
Place in the oven for 40 mins.
Now mix the frozen cranberries with the maple syrup and place on top of pie, cook for 5 minutes, the cranberries can burn easily so keep an eye on them 😊

Ingredients

1 x packet of gnocchi (I use Ocado’s own)
1/2 packet of kale
1 x red or yellow pepper
Generous handful of Kalamata olives, mashed, stoned and ripped in half
8-10 baby plum tomatoes
A generous tablespoon of nut-free pesto – I use Zest with coriander
Olive oil
Cracked black pepper
Cracked sea salt
Optional:
Roasted chickpeas
Spring onion
(See serving suggestion below)

","
Preparation
Serves 2

Method

Put a frying pan on a medium heat and add a generous splash of olive oil
Pour in half the packet of gnocchi
Add pepper and salt and stir – keep stirring every now and then as prepare the veg
Chuck the kale in a colander and wash thoroughly. Set aside
Chop up the pepper into bite sized squares
Quarter your tomatoes
Squash each olive with the back of your knife to pop out the stone, rip in half
Pour kale onto board with rest of veg and assess the frying gnocchi – if the gnocchi is starting to turn a light gold colour, turn down the heat and fill the kettle up with water
Pour boiling water into a saucepan, on a medium/high heat and throw in the remaining gnocchi
When each of the gnocchi have floated to the surface (after a couple of minutes) turn down the heat and pour into the colander to drain
In the same pan, on a low heat, put a generous dollop of pesto
Add the peppers, tomatoes and olives and mix together
Check that your fried gnocchi is nearly done – you want it golden in colour, with a crunchy outside and a soft middle. Try if you are unsure
Add the boiled gnocchi to your pesto mix and then add the kale, stirring as you go
When the kale is starting to wilt and darken in colour, turn off the heat on both pans
Serves immediately onto warmed plates, with the pesto-covered gnocchi in the centre and some crunchy fried gnocchi round the edges
Add a little cracked pepper on top

TIP: Leave some for seconds as it is very moreish, but the gnocchi is more filling than you imagine. Best enjoyed with a cool glass of vino!
Serving suggestion: Top with roasted chickpeas and spring onion for an extra twist (second image). Chickpeas are so easy to roast: drain and rinse a can of chickpeas in cold water, pour onto a clean tea towel and dry off as much of the moisture as possible, pour into a bowl, add a splash of olive oil and a half a teaspoon of each of the following: cayenne pepper, oregano, celery salt and garlic granules (this is my favourite mix, but you can experiment with any flavours you like really), and mix well, pour onto a baking sheet and roast for 20 minutes at about 220, and then leave for 5 minutes or so to cool.

Basic ingredients:
1 cup chickpea flour
1 tbs flax
½ tsp salt
½ tsp general mixed seasoning
½ tsp baking powder
¼ tsp baking soda
half a head of a small-med cauliflower (equal to 1 cup grated)
½ an onion sliced thinly
1 cup water
Options – add one of these (or more than one if making mini quiches):
1/2 cup black beans (I teamed this with a smoky chipotle sauce and nutritional yeast)
1/2 cup corn and sliced red onion (I used frozen corn and added paprika)
1/2 cup sliced red pepper and sun-dried tomatoes (I teamed this with fresh basil)
1/2 cup chopped spinach (I teamed this with garlic)
1/2 cup sliced courgette (I teamed this with dried Italian herbs and fresh rosemary)
","
Method

Mix the dry ingredients together and set aside.


Chop the onion finely and grate/process the cauliflower (to a rice-like consistency) and add both to the dry mix, then add the water and mix through well.


If you are making mini quiches, separate the batter now.


Stir through your chosen additions (add flavours at the same time as the other ingredients in previous steps if more appropriate to do so)


The mixture should be thick and clumpy but easy to spoon into a tin.


I used an 8” silicone cake tin, but you could also use a metal one with removable bottom, or large silicone muffin cups.


Press the mixture firmly into the pan but leave the top quite rough for some nice texture.


Bake at 180C for approx 30 mins until the tops are nice and golden, or around 20 minutes for mini quiches (keep an eye on the colour).


Serve either hot or cold.

Ingredients
For the spices:

½ tsp coriander seeds
½ tsp ginger
1 tsp smoked paprika
½ tsp allspice berries
1 cardamom
½ tsp ground mace
½ tsp turmeric
½ tsp cayenne pepper
½ tsp chilli flakes
½ tsp sea salt flakes
½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tbsp agave syrup
2 large red onions
2 cloves of garlic
1 large butternut squash
1 fennel bulb
1 large aubergine
1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes
1 tbsp tomato puree

","
Method
Place the cardamom, coriander seeds and allspice berries in a dry frying pan and heat over a medium flame until you can smell their fragrant scent – about 1 minute but keep an eye on them.  Transfer to a pestle and mortar and grind to a fine powder.
Next, combine all of the spices together in a small bowl.  Pour over 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and all of the agave syrup.  Stir together until combined.
Preheat the oven to 120c.  Peel the onion and cut into half moon slices, slice the garlic into thin rounds.  Next, peel and deseed the squash.  Chop the squash, fennel and aubergine into large chunks approximately 4 cm in size.
Heat the remaining olive oil in a large heavy based casserole.  Gently fry the onion and garlic until softened.
Add the squash and fry with the onion until the squash begins to give at the edges.
Add the fennel and aubergine to the pan and stir together.  Pour over the spice mixture and stir in until evenly mixed, frying for a further minute.
Pour over the tomatoes and puree, bring to a rolling simmer and then cover and transfer to the oven to cook slowly for 2 – 3 hours.

Ingredients

For the pesto:
2 shallots, minced
10 leaves of fresh sage, minced
1 tbsp coconut oil
1/8 tsp cinnamon
2 1/2 tbsp maple syrup
1 tbsp fresh parsley
1 tbsp tahini
1 cup shelled pistachios
2 tsp apple cider vinegar
Olive oil to thin, as needed
For the gnocchi:
1/2 of a butternut squash, seeded
2 large beets, peeled
1 medium sweet potato, peeled
1 medium celeriac, peeled
1 large parsnip, peeled
1 medium turnip, peeled
4-6 cups brown rice flour, divided, plus more for dusting

","
Preparation
Combining quintessential autumnal flavors—sage, maple syrup, cinnamon—with an array of multi-colored root vegetables, this perfect fall entrée is sophisticated comfort food at its finest. While the combination of root vegetables produces an aesthetically striking dish, it does complicate the process a bit. If you’d like to make the recipe simpler, simply use one root vegetable instead of all six.

Method
Preheat the oven to 400°F.
Wrap the beets, sweet potato, celeriac, parsnip, and turnip each individually in aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet. Place the butternut squash, face-down, on the baking sheet, as well. Roast all of the veggies for 45-60 minutes until you can pierce through them with a fork. Remove from the oven and let sit until cool enough to handle.
Meanwhile, make the pesto. Heat the coconut oil over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the shallots and sage. Sauté for 5-10 minutes, or until golden brown. Add the sauté to a food processor along with the rest of the pesto ingredients, except for the olive oil. Pulse until well combined, scraping down the sides as necessary. As the motor is running, drizzle in olive oil to achieve the desired consistency.
Set a large pot of salted water to boil.
Once the veggies have cooled, puree each of them separately in a food processor (or mash them separately with a potato masher) and place the purees into separate bowls. Make sure that you process the beets last so as not to stain the other veggie purees with a magenta hue. Combine the purees of celeriac, turnip, and parsnip. You’ll have four bowls of puree in front of you: one deep orange (butternut squash), one light orange (sweet potato), one magenta (beet), and one white (celeriac, turnip, and parsnip). Combine each of the purees with 1 cup of brown rice flour, adding more to each bowl to achieve an ever-so-slightly sticky consistency (the butternut squash and sweet potato purees will require less than the others).
Dust a work surface with additional flour. Divide each dough into two portions and roll them into snakes about 1/2-inch in width. Cut each snake into 10-20 gnocchi and place in a single layer on a baking sheet.
Once the pot of water is boiling, drop the gnocchi—ten at a time and only with gnocchi of like color—into the pot. Cook until the gnocchi floats to the top, about 30 seconds. Remove the gnocchi from the water and place in a colander sitting over a bowl to allow the water to drain.
Combine all of the gnocchi in a large bowl (at this point, the boiling will have sealed their color, so it’s safe to combine them). Add the pesto and stir well to coat. Serve warm.

1 tsp Vanilla Extract tsp
1,000 g Icing Sugar
30 g Cocoa Powder
250 g Vegan Butter
2 tbs Soya Milk
125 g Black cherry jam
","
Method
1. For the swiss roll. Preheat your oven to 160ºC Fan/Gas 3. Line a shallow baking tray approximately 30cm x 20cm with greaseproof paper.
2. Sift the flour and cocoa powder into a large bowl, then add the cornflour, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, salt and sugar and stir together.
3. Pour the milk, vinegar, oil and vanilla extract into a jug and whisk until combined.
4. Add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir well with a light hand, be careful not to overwork the batter then pour into the prepared baking tray and bake in the oven for approximately 25 minutes until cooked through and a skewer comes out clean.
5. Meanwhile for the buttercream. Add the icing sugar, cocoa powder and the butter into a food processor and blitz together. Add the soya milk, a little at a time until the buttercream starts to combine and is smooth. You want a medium to firm texture. Split into two bowls.
6. Once the cake is cooked. Leave to cool for around 5 minutes and then carefully roll into a swiss roll shape, keeping the greaseproof paper on. When cooled after around half an hour, gently unroll the log and spread with black cherry jam followed by half of the buttercream. Once again carefully re-roll the cake this time carefully removing the greaseproof paper as you roll. Once rolled, place the log on a piece of clingfilm and roll tightly and place in the fridge to chill until needed, you could actually freeze the cake at this stage for half an hour.
7. To assemble. Remove the cling film from the swiss roll and cover the outer swiss roll with the remaining buttercream. We use a piping bag for this and pipe lines down sides of the roll then use a fork to create a textured log effect.
8. Sprinkle with icing sugar and serve.
NOTES
1. You could use holly, sprinkles or vegan edible decorations for garnish, Christmas is the occasion to go all out with your decorating.
2. For ease you could just use jam inside the yuletide log and buttercream the outside only.

Mushrooms, chopped
Red/Yellow Pepper, finely chopped
Tomatoes, finely sliced
Vegan cheese (find our guide to the best vegan cheese here)
Fresh chilli
Artichokes
Fresh rocket (to sprinkle over the top after cooking)
Pine Nuts
Fresh basil
Chilli infused olive oil (to sprinkle over the top after cooking)
Roasted garlic
Spinach

","
Preparation
Make the easy pizza tomato sauce: 
Finely chop one onion and a couple of cloves of garlic. Add to a frying pan with a little olive oil.
Add half a teaspoon (each) of oregano, basil and thyme and mix.
Add a can of chopped tomatoes, a little salt and cracked pepper and leave to simmer and thicken. If you don’t let the sauce thicken enough, your toppings can all slide off when eating. So this is why you need a little time to make the sauce. You don’t want it in any way watery.

Method
Assemble your pizza:

Make tomato sauce or use a base with sauce already added.
Preheat your oven to 220C.
Wash some kale and add it to a frying pan with a little olive oil. Sauté for a few minutes until the kale is dark green. Turn off heat.
Chop the rest of your ingredients and grate the cheese.
Create your pizza! Add sauce, kale, olives, mushrooms, pepper, tomato and, lastly (after 5/10 minutes in the oven) cheese – but you can really do any order you want.
Remove and eat in great big slices!

Display 4 bread slices in a tray.
On each bread slice display the seitan, the sausages, the ham, the mushrooms, the tomato slices and another slice of bread on the top.
Display the cheese slices in order to cover the bread on the top, and after melting a little they should cover all the sides.
Take the tray to the oven at 200º C just to warm up and melt the cheese.
Meanwhile, prepare the sauce by adding all the ingredients in a food processer to mix everything. Take it to boil, taste it and rectify the seasoning if necessary.
Serve each “francesinha” with the hot sauce on it. Some French fries combine very well with it.

Once the onions begin to brown, add the water, white wine, soy cream, bouillon, soy sauce, and spice. Cook for about 15 minutes over medium-low heat (just below simmering), stirring occasionally.
Taste and add salt and pepper if desired. Remove from heat and incorporate the cashew butter to make the sauce creamier. Serve with rice or quinoa.

Ingredients

1 cup ripe plums, pitted and quartered
1 small frozen banana, sliced
1/3 cup cashews, soaked overnight
3 Medjool dates, pitted and chopped
3 tbsp fresh rosemary, chopped
¼ tsp vanilla extract
1 14-oz can full-fat coconut milk
½ cup non-dairy milk

","
Preparation
Since I  do not own an ice cream maker, nor, I’m sure, do many of you, I’ve offered instructions for two methods of making this ice cream with no more appliances than a freezer, a spoon, and maybe a food processor. 

Method
Combine all of the ingredients in a blender and puree until very smooth.
Ice Cream Machine Method: 
Pour the pureed mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the maker’s instructions. Transfer to a container and store in the freezer.
Non-Ice Cream Machine Methods: 
Pour the pureed mixture into a large Tupperware container, a deep baking dish, or a stainless steel bowl and place inside the freezer. After 45 minutes, remove the mixture from the freezer and stir it vigorously with a spatula or whisk, breaking up any frozen sections. Return the mixture to the freezer, stirring vigorously every 30 minutes for about 2-3 hours, or until the mixture is completely frozen. Store in the freezer. With this method, you’ll have to thaw the ice cream for at least 10 minutes before serving.
An alternative non-ice cream machine method is to pour the pureed mixture into an ice cube tray and freeze completely. When you’d like to enjoy a bowl of ice cream, pop a couple of the frozen cubes out of the tray and blend in a food processor until creamy.

Ingredients

1 pack uncooked noodles
4 Tbsp (level) sweet white miso
3-4 Tbsp tahini
100ml cold water [UK 3.5 fl oz / USA 3.4 fl oz]
2 Tbsp brown rice vinegar
1 Tbsp mirin
3cm [1.2″] fresh ginger root grated and then squeezed for its juice
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
Pinch of dried tarragon, basil or thyme
Roasted red pepper, thinly sliced (store bought – organic jar)
Finely chopped spring onion

","
Method

Boil the noodles in 2.5 litres of water according to the cooking instructions. [UK 4.4 pints]
Mix the miso and tahini in a small saucepan.
Add the water a little at a time and mix well to make a smooth sauce.
Add the remaining ingredients and bring to a gentle simmer.  If it’s too thick, add a bit more water, if it’s too thin, simmer briefly to thicken the sauce.
To serve, put the noodles into individual serving bowls, spoon the sauce over the top, and garnish with the spring onion and finely sliced red peppers.

"
668,https://veganuary.com/recipes/vegan-roast-veg-pesto-tofu-cauliflower-pizza/,Roast Veg Pizza on a Cauliflower Base,"
Ingredients

PIZZA CRUST BASE
400g cauliflower (approx. half a large head of cauliflower or one small one)
15g ground chia seeds
25g Pulsin Soya Protein Powder
50g ground almonds
40g nutritional yeast
Chia egg substitute: 2 tbsp milled chia mixed with 5 tbsp water (equivalent to 2 eggs)
1 tbsp dried mixed herbs
Salt and pepper
TOMATO SAUCE TOPPING
1 tbsp ground flaxseed (this is optional but it helps thicken the sauce and adds omega-3s and fibre!)
1 1/2 tbsp sugar-free apple sauce
5 tbsp tomato purée
2 tbsp tamari
1.5 tbsp dried oregano
Salt and pepper
2 garlic cloves, crushed
TOPPINGS: The fun bit!
Of course, you can add what toppings you like here. I have topped mine with roasted vegetables: sliced beetroot, cubes of roasted sweet potato, red onion chunks, red pepper chunks-roasted with a little rapeseed oil for 30-40 mins.
For 2 medium pizzas you will need:
1 large beetroot, peeled & sliced
2 red onions
1 1/2 red pepper
1 medium sweet potato
100g Basil pesto tofu (available in supermarkets), sliced
3-4 tbsp nutritional yeast

","
Method
 

Remove the leaves from the cauliflower and cut into chunks. Then using a blender or food processor, blitz the cauliflower until it is finely chopped so that it resembles rice, i.e. cauliflower crumb


Transfer the crumb into a steamer and steam for 15 mins or microwave in a bowl with cling-film (with a hole or two on top) for 6 mins until soft


Preheat the oven to 200ºC (180ºC fan). Line 2 large baking sheets with greaseproof paper and a little coconut spray oil


Allow the cooked cauliflower crumb to cool before transferring into a clean tea towel and squeezing as much moisture as you can out. (Really wring it!) You may need more than one tea towel


Transfer the dehydrated cauliflower crumb into a bowl and add the remaining pizza base ingredients: ground chia seeds, protein powder (I used Pulsin Soya Protein powder), ground almonds, nutritional yeast, chia egg substitute, dried mixed herbs, a large pinch of salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper


Using your hands, divide the pizza mixture in half and place directly on each baking sheet. Shape into a ball and then press down to form a round pizza base shape


Bake for 15 mins until the bases are golden brown and starting to crisp a little at the edges. If you want your base extra crispy, half-way through baking, flip it over to ensure both sides are well baked


Whilst the base is baking, mix together the ground flaxseed, sugar-free apple sauce, tomato purée, tamari, dried oregano, garlic and season with salt and pepper


Spread the tomato topping onto each of the pizza bases


Then top your pizza with your topping of choice. I Have chosen roasted vegetables and slices of basil pesto tofu. Sprinkle over with nutritional yeast


Turn the oven up to 240ºC (220ºC fan) and bake for a further 12- 15 mins


I love to serve mine with a large handful of fresh rocket on top and a side salad. Enjoy!

The key to making a great cauliflower crust pizza is by making a cauliflower crumb and then dehydrating it, so that as much moisture is squeezed out as possible, allowing the remaining crumb to be turned into a crispy pizza base. (If you don’t squeeze out the moisture, the base will be all soggy). You will be surprised with the amount of liquid which comes out! But this delicious grain-free pizza is well worth the effort.
There are two ways you can dehydrate your cauliflower crumb: the more time-consuming method is by putting the cooked cauliflower crumb in a tea-towel or two and wringing out the moisture. (I think of this as stress relief!). Alternatively, if you are lucky enough to have a juicer, you can simply feed cauliflower florets through the juicer and collect the residual crumb and mix this directly with the remaining pizza base ingredients. (No need to cook before using!).
So why not give this recipe a go, to create a delicious vegan pizza chock full of vegetables!

300g (4 cups) breadcrumbs
125g (1 cup) gram flour
Vegetable oil, for shallow frying (optional)
Sea salt and black pepper, to taste

Add 100g of the breadcrumbs and the gram flour to the bowl with some seasoning and mix well. Pour in the flax mixture and combine everything into a paste using a spatula or clean hands.
If baking the nuggets, preheat the oven to 180°C (Gas Mark 4, 350°F) and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. If frying the nuggets, gently heat 1 cm of oil in a large frying pan.
Taking tablespoons of the vegetable mixture, shape into nuggets and roll in the breadcrumbs to lightly coat each one.

350g caster sugar [UK 12oz / US 1 ½ cup]
85g cocoa powder [UK 3oz / US 3/4 cup]
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
125ml vegetable oil [UK 4 ½ fl oz / US 1/2 cup]
2 tsp vanilla extract
250g grated courgettes [9oz]
300ml almond milk [UK 10 ½ fl oz / US 1 ¼ cup]
375g icing sugar [UK 13oz / US 3 cups]
1 ½ tbsp cocoa powder
75g dairy-free butter (+extra for greasing) [UK 3oz / US 1/3 cup]
4 ½ tbsp boiling water

","
Method

Pre-heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
Grease 2 x 23cm / 9in non-stick springform cake pans with dairy-free butter. Line bottoms of the cake pans with greaseproof paper.
In a large bowl, sieve together plain flour, caster sugar, 85g cocoa, baking powder and bicarbonate of soda.
Add almond milk, vanilla extract and vegetable oil. Mix well.
Add grated courgettes and mix until all is well combined.
Divide the mixture evenly between the two cake tins.
Cook for 25-30 mins until an inserted cake skewer comes out clean. Leave the cakes to cool for 5 mins in their tins then carefully remove the sides of the springform cake pans. Run a palette or rounded knife on the inside edge of the cake pans first to make sure the cake comes out neatly. Cool completely.
Once you are ready to ice the cake, prepare the chocolate icing. In a bowl, melt 75g of dairy-free butter with boiling water. In a separate bowl, mix together the icing sugar with 1 1/2 tbsp sieved cocoa powder. Add the melted butter to the sugar mixture. Blend well until you have a smooth icing.
Assemble the cake by placing one cake on a serving plate (having carefully removed the baking sheet). Spread some chocolate icing over the first cake then top with the other cake (from which you will also have carefully removed the baking sheet). Ice the cake all over with the chocolate icing with a palette knife. So it does not get too messy you can place some long strips of baking paper around the edges of the cake while you ice it. Leave to icing to set (around 20 mins).

340g extra firm tofu
3 tablespoons tamari/soy sauce
3 pineapple rings
1 tablespoon rice vinegar
2 whole pitted dates (or more depending on desired sweetness)	
½ red pepper
½ yellow pepper
2 cloves garlic
2 chillies, medium hot
3 sticks spring onion
Sesame oil (optional, for greasing the pan)

","
Preparation
Serves 2

Blend the rice vinegar, tamari, dates and one pineapple ring to a fine paste.
Either mince or finely grate the garlic cloves.
Cut the remaining pineapple and bell peppers into 1-inch cube-shape pieces.
Drain the water from the tofu, and cut the tofu into 1-inch cube-shape pieces.
Slice the chillies and spring onions into rings.


Method

Warm up a non-stick pan and keep on low heat.
When the pan is warm, add the tofu pieces.
As the tofu pieces cook they will release water – simply allow the water to steam off.
Toss the tofu pieces so that they do not stick to the pan.
Let the pieces brown slightly, or cook until they are hot to touch.
Increase the heat if the tofu pieces are not browning.
Add the garlic and stir when necessary to prevent the garlic from burning.
When you get the aroma of the garlic, add the chillies and stir.
Add the remaining ingredients, except for the spring onions.
Let all the flavours blend. If using canned pineapple add the pineapple juice if the tofu is absorbing all the liquid.
Allow to simmer for about 5 minutes, or until all the tofu pieces have been coated well.
Take off the heat and finally add the spring onions.

* This dish can be made in advance; heat it up before serving.
* This dish can be served with rice or noodles.

½ tsp coriander seeds
3 Tbsp vegetable oil
2 tsp garam masala
½ tsp ground turmeric
¼ tsp fenugreek powder
¼ tsp chili powder
1 tsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp ground ginger
1 dried chili
5 curry leaves
1 cinnamon stick, snapped in half

1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, crushed
Thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger, peeled and grated
2 large tomatoes, roughly chopped
500g peeled, de-seeded butternut squash chunks (around 1 small squash)
200ml coconut milk
350ml vegetable stock
1 x 400g can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
3 Tbsp fresh/frozen coriander, roughly chopped or torn
4 tsp flaked almonds

","
Method

Place a large saucepan over medium heat and add the coriander seeds. Allow them to toast, swirling the pan, for a few minutes until smoky and fragrant. Don’t allow them to burn. Remove them from the heat and grind roughly in a mortar and pestle or spice grinder.
Add the oil to the pan and add the spices, including the ground coriander seeds, dried chili, and curry leaves. Stirring constantly, allow the spices to temper in the hot oil until bubbling and very fragrant.
Add the chopped onion to the pan and stir. Fry for around two minutes but don’t let the onion brown (lower the heat if necessary). Add the garlic and ginger and cook for a further 2 minutes.
Add the chopped tomatoes and stir well. If the onions are starting to stick at this stage, add 3-5 tbsp of water along with the tomatoes to deglaze the pan. Cook, stirring often until the tomatoes are starting to break down and lose their shape – around 5 minutes.
Add the cubes of butternut squash and the chickpeas and stir to coat in the curry paste. Add the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Stirring occasionally, allow the curry to simmer with a lid on for around 10-15 minutes or until the squash is cooked.
Once the squash is cooked and the sauce has reduced nicely, add the coconut milk and stir. Lower the heat and allow the curry to simmer for a few moments before removing from the heat.
Stir in the coriander and top with the flaked almonds. Serve with steamed basmati rice and/or Rotis.

Ingredients

130g gluten-free plain flour, plus extra for handling
100g gram flour
1 tbsp baking powder
5 sundried tomatoes, plus 2 tbsp of their oil
150ml almond milk – or your favourite dairy-free milk
1 tsp cider vinegar – or 1 tbsp lemon juice 

","
Preparation

Makes 1 loaf


Method
Preheat the oven to 220c.
Place all of the dried ingredients into a large mixing bowl and stir together. Next add the sundried tomatoes and toss together in the flours so that the pieces become coated – this will allow them to become evenly distributed.
Pour over the almond milk, oil and cider vinegar (or lemon juice) and then mix together until you have a large, tacky ball of dough. Coat your hands in extra flour and carefully lift the loose dough and place on to a large baking tray, shaping it into a round loaf approximately 6 inches in diameter.
Score the top of the loaf into 8 segments (you can be quite light with the knife as the dough is so soft). Bake the bread in the oven for 15-18 minutes or until golden and crusty. Remove from the oven, leave to cool for 10 minutes and then cut into segments and enjoy.

"
694,https://veganuary.com/recipes/beer-battered-chickn-bites/,Beer Battered Chicken Bites,"
Ingredients

1/2 cup of chicken-style pieces
1 1/2 cup plain flour
1tsp baking powder
1 x 375ml of chilled vegan beer/lager (I used Coors Light but as long as it is vegan feel free to choose your personal favourite)
1/2tsp each of salt
pepper
onion powder and garlic powder
2tsp dried mixed herbs
Around 400ml of oil for frying but the exact amount depends on the size of your fryer.

","
Preparation

You’ll need to pre-heat the oil in your deep fryer.
If your chicken-style pieces are frozen then begin by defrosting them ready for use.


Method
Add together all of the dry ingredients – flour, baking powder and dried seasonings – and combine well.
Make a well in the centre of the dried ingredients and add the bottle of chilled beer. Stir well to combine until a smooth batter has formed.
You can drop a small amount of batter into the frying oil if you need to check to see if it is hot enough. The oil will sizzle and the batter begin to puff up if the oil is indeed hot enough.
Dip the chicken-style pieces into the batter and, once fully coated, drop carefully into the oil. You may need to do this in several batches if you have only a small fryer so be patient and be sure not to overcrowd the fryer because the batter needs enough room to properly cook.
Fry for 5 minutes or so, until crispy and golden in appearance, and then transfer to a paper towel in order to remove the oily residue.
Serve up as a side dish to any Chinese meal, with chips and ketchup or even as a snack on its own with sweet chilli sauce.

Ingredients

The Meaty Part:
1 jar seitan
1 pack tempeh
1 tbsp sesame oil
2 tbsp shoyu or tamari sauce
1 cup water
Sauté the vegetables:
1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
2 cloves garlic, crushed
2 celery stalks finely diced
2 carrots, finely diced
2 shallots, finely diced
10 fresh shitake mushrooms
½ tsp herbs de Provence
¼ tsp each, ginger powder, turmeric, paprika
1 tbsp mirin
1 tbsp shoyu or tamari sauce
4 tbsp rice flower
4 tbsp strong wheat flour
2 tbsp organic sunflower oil for frying

","
Method

Mince the seitan chunks by using a small hand grinder and transfer to a bowl.
Crumble the tempeh in your fingers and add to the seitan.
Heat the oil in a pan and add the ground seitan and crumbled tempeh.
Stir well to coat in oil and then add the shoyu sauce and water stir and then cover.
Simmer on low heat for about 15 minutes or until all liquid is absorbed.
Return the ingredients to the mixing bowl.
Warm the wok or pan and add the oil.
Stir in the garlic, celery, carrots, shallots, mushrooms, herbs and seasonings. Mix to coat all the contents in oil.
Add the mirin and shoyu and pop the lid on the pan and cook on low heat for 5 minutes.
Place this mixture into the seitan/tempeh bowl and mix well. Sprinkle the flour on top and using a spatula blend and fold until you achieve a solid consistency.
I then prefer to chill the mixture for one hour or more in the fridge to allow the mixture to stiffen.
To make the burgers simply take one heaped tablespoon of mixture and roll in your hands, squeezing and then flatten into a burger shape.
Warm the sunflower oil in a deep based pan and add the burgers, fry on each side for 5 minutes until crisp and golden.

Delicious served on toasted sourdough. Spread vegan mayonnaise on the bread; add a hefty layer of rocket or other salad greens (pre-dressed) in your favourite salad dressing.  Pop on a burger and top with some homemade pickles or relish, sliced tomatoes or whatever your heart desires.

Ingredients

3 x zucchini (courgettes)
Half a jar of vegan pesto
Kalamata olives (optional – I love them!)
About a dozen baby plum tomatoes – halved
A few good handfuls of rocket
Smoked paprika
Cayenne Pepper
Can of chickpeas
Oregano
Celery Salt
Garlic Granules
Olive Oil

","
Preparation
Serves 2-4, depending on portion size!

Method

Preheat your oven to 220C
Drain and rinse a can of chickpeas in cold water. Pour onto a clean tea towel and dry off as much of the moisture as possible. Pour into a bowl and add a splash of olive oil and a half a teaspoon of each of the following: cayenne pepper, oregano, celery salt and garlic granules (I made up this mix when I was trying to find a recipe for roasted chickpeas but didn’t quite have the right spices/herbs in stock – it is now my favourite, but you can experiment with any flavours you like really), and mix well. Pour onto a baking sheet so that all the chickpeas are flat and roast for 20 minutes. Set aside.
At the same time the chickpeas are roasting you can also roast the tomatoes. I simply lay my halved tomatoes out on a small baking tray, sprinkle with smoked paprika and bung in the oven. No oil or anything else. I think it is personal preference how roasted you like tomatoes, so I leave mine in for slightly less than the chick peas – about 15 minutes. Once cooked to your liking, set aside.
While the chickpeas and tomatoes are roasting, make your zoodles. You basically want to zoodle as much of the three zucchini as possible. (This is a really fun thing to make with someone else, as you can have ‘Who can make the best/longest zoodle’ competitions!)
I like my zoodles practically raw, so this next part is pretty quick…
On a very low heat, pour about half a jar of vegan pesto into a pan and add your roast tomatoes and olives. Gradually add the zoodles, mixing all the time to coat them with the pesto mix. Once all mixed in they are ready to serve.
Wash your rocket and put a good handful onto each plate.
Spoon the zoodle mixture on top of the rocket and the sprinkle with as many of the roasted chickpeas as you desire.
Eat!

In a large bowl, coarsely mash beans with a fork. Add in sweet potato and mash together, then add in spices, salt and pepper, minced garlic, vegan egg, bread crumbs and flour. Mix together until combined, then place bowl in the fridge for 20-30 minutes.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons olive oil. Remove mixture from fridge and form into 8-10 patties, then place in the skillet once hot. Since the mixture can be wet and messy, do not move until they are fully cooked and golden on one side. This takes about 3-5 minutes on each side. Then, add more oil if needed  and flip burgers very gently. Cook for another 3-5 minutes. Toast buns if desired.
Assemble by topping burgers with roasted garlic aioli and toppings!
To make aioli: While burger mixture is chilling, combine aioli ingredients in a bowl until smooth then cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

710,https://veganuary.com/recipes/stuffed-butternut-squash-with-maple-syrup-and-freekeh/,Stuffed Butternut Squash with Maple Syrup and Freekeh,"
Ingredients
For the butternut:

1 butternut squash
1 tsp coconut oil (solid)
2 tsp pure maple syrup
½ tsp cinnamon
10g fresh thyme

For the stuffing:

100g freekeh
500ml water
1 tsp oil
250g chestnut mushrooms (dried mushrooms, such as porcini, would also work well)
1 red onion
4 cloves garlic
½ tsp dried chilli flakes
10g fresh thyme
20g dried sour cherries
30g pecans, chopped into small pieces

","
Method

Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
To prepare the butternut, use a sharp knife to top and tail it and then cut lengthways down the middle. Scoop out the seeds and stringy bits using a spoon. Next, slice a criss-cross pattern across the flesh – this ensures the butternut can soak up all of the lovely coconut oil and maple syrup (and helps it to cook more quickly).
Drizzle half of the maple syrup onto each half of the butternut and into the scooped-out cavity, followed by the oil (the oil can be melted in advance, or spread on solid). Sprinkle on the cinnamon and thyme leaves.
Place on a baking tray and cook for 45 minutes to an hour. It may take longer depending on the size of the butternut; just keep an eye on it (and cover with foil if you think it’s at risk of burning). It should turn a lovely caramelised brown, and should be soft, but not mushy.
While the butternut is cooking, prepare the freekeh. This usually involves simmering it in water for about 15 minutes, but check the instructions on the packet.
Chop the onion, garlic and mushrooms and heat the oil in a frying pan. Cook on a medium heat with the dried chilli flakes until the onions are soft and lightly browned. Add the thyme leaves, cherries and pecans and give it all a stir, helping the cherries to absorb the lovely flavours. The aroma is amazing! Add the freekeh, stir to combine and remove from the heat.
To serve, pile some spoonfuls of the lovely stuffing into the butternut and reserve some for the table (or to eat the next day in a tasty salad).

714,https://veganuary.com/recipes/big-puff-pie/,Big Puff Pie,"
Ingredients
Pie Filling:
2 tbsp olive oil
1 medium-large onion, chopped
1 clove garlic, crushed
200g/7oz mushrooms, chopped if medium or large, left whole if small button variety
One of the protein options as mentioned in Preparation
6 tsp vegan gravy granules (plain Bisto is fine) made up with 300g/12fl oz boiling water
1 tbsp porcini mushrooms, soaked in boiled water then chopped into small pieces with scissors. Reserve the soaking water and include it in the 300ml needed for the gravy – see above
1 tbsp Dijon mustard
1 tsp mixed dried herbs
1-2 tsp shoyu or tamari type soya sauce
2 tbsp sherry or red wine
100g/3oz frozen peas
Black pepper (gravy granules and soya sauce should provide enough salt)
Pie Crust:
1 pack Jus-Rol puff pastry sheet (sold fresh or frozen in most supermarkets) OR a pack of Jus-Rol solid puff pastry, rolled out by hand
Oil spray or a little vegetable oil
A little soya or other unsweetened plant milk (almond, coconut, hemp) to brush top of pastry
","
Preparation
Choose from ONE of the four protein options below:

Tempeh, 225g pack. Steam for about 5 minutes then chop into cubes and fry in a little oil and drizzle with soya sauce
Frozen tofu, 225g pack or thereabouts. Freezing tofu gives it a more solid, chewy texture. Chop it into cubes then place in a plastic tub with an airtight lid in the freezer. Defrost before using and fry in hot oil until golden brown and drizzle with soya sauce.
Seitan (wheat gluten). Yakso brand 350g jars from health food shops OR Companion brand plain gluten or veggie chicken, 300g tins from Oriental grocers – drain each of these. Any liquid can be incorporated into the pie’s gravy.
TVP dried chunks, about 10-15, soaked in hot stock for 20-30 minutes until soft enough to cook.


Method

If using tofu, chop it into about 16 cubes and freeze overnight. Remove it from the freezer a few hours before you make the pie.
If using tempeh, it can be chopped with a big sharp knife while frozen. Otherwise leave it to defrost in the fridge a few hours before it is needed. Prepare as above.
If using TVP chunks, soak them in hot stock for a few minutes while you prepare everything else. Drain and squeeze gently before adding to pie.
If using seitan/gluten, drain, reserve liquid and set aside until ready.
Pre-heat oven to 225°C/450°F/Gas Mark 7.
Heat olive oil in a medium-large saucepan.
Sauté (gently fry) onion and garlic until onion is translucent – about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook for 3-4 minutes.
Add the protein option of choice and gently stir in with rest of vegetables to coat with oil.
Make the gravy as above then add the mustard, herbs, soya sauce and sherry/wine and mix in well.
Add the peas, porcini mushrooms, gravy mixture and all other ingredients to the pie filling (except the pastry and soya milk).
Stir carefully to mix in well, taste and season if necessary, then turn down heat and leave to simmer.
Meanwhile, choose an oven-proof dish (or individual oven-proof dishes) that will hold the pie filling.
Use its shape to cut out a pastry lid – or several small shapes if you are using individual pie containers. Lightly oil a non-stick baking sheet or tray and place the pastry lid(s) on it. If using several lids space them out on the baking tray.
Brush with a little soya or other plant milk and bake in the hot oven for approximately 20 minutes, or according to the packet instructions – the pastry should be well risen and golden brown.
Spoon the stew into dish or dishes, place the pastry lid(s) on top and serve immediately.

717,https://veganuary.com/recipes/club-mexicanas-bbq-pulled-jackfruit/,Club Mexicana’s BBQ Pulled Jackfruit,"
Ingredients

2 jalapeños, finely chopped
2 tbsp vegetable oil
6 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 tbsp chilli powder
2 tsp cumin
0.5 tsp cayenne
500ml ketchup
125ml (1/2 cup) lime juice (more if you like it tangy)
1 cup dark brown sugar
4 tins (cans) of jackfruit in brine
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 tbsp dijon mustard

","
Method

Fry the garlic & jalapeños in oil for a minute. Add all the spices, stir and cook until fragrant (a minute or so). Add ketchup, lime and brown sugar. Stir until all the sugar has melted. Partially cover and keep cooking on a low heat until sauce has thickened to the consistency of ketchup.


Drain and thoroughly rinse the tinned jackfruit. Use your hands to tear the strands of jackfruit from the harder core. The fruit will come apart very easily. Put the pulled jackfruit into a bowl and put the cores into another bowl. Once everything has been pulled apart use a knife to finely chop the harder cores. It doesn’t matter if these are still a bit chunky once chopped as it adds more texture to the dish.


Heat oil in pan and add the pulled jackfruit. Cook until it gets a bit grey and loses some moisture. Add the dijon mustard and stir in. Add a little water if it starts to stick to the pan.


Add about half the BBQ sauce (more if you want a very sticky dish) and stir in to coat. Cook until it’s almost starting to get a little crispy and sticking to the pan a little.


Spoon on top of warm corn tacos and top with cos lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, a squeeze of fresh lime and a sprinkle of coriander.

718,https://veganuary.com/recipes/non-dairy-gorgonzola/,Non-Dairy Gorgonzola,"
Ingredients

½ block (7 oz) extra-firm water-packed tofu (not silken tofu)
¼ cup organic refined coconut oil (not virgin coconut oil)
2 tbsp mellow white miso paste
4 tsp white wine or champagne vinegar
2 tsp fresh lemon juice
1 tsp fine sea salt or kosher salt
½ tsp onion powder
¼ tsp garlic powder
⅛ tsp blue-green algae powder (spirulina)

","
Preparation

For this cheese you will need a glass, ceramic, metal or BPA-free plastic container which will hold a minimum of 1 and ½ cup liquid; this will act as the form to shape the cheese. This recipe yields about 8 ounces.


Method
Line the form with plastic wrap or a double-layer of cheesecloth, being sure to leave some excess hanging over the sides. This will help lift the cheese from the form after firming.
Drain and press the tofu until it is not releasing any more liquid. It is essential to dry the tofu as much as possible for the proper texture. Crumble the tofu into a food processor.
Remove the metal lid from the jar of coconut oil and place the jar in a microwave. Heat just until the solid oil liquefies, about 30 seconds to 1 minute (this will depend upon the solidity of the coconut oil). Alternately, place the jar in about an inch of simmering water and melt the oil in the same manner. Measure ¼ cup and add to the food processor with the remaining ingredients except for the algae powder. Process the contents until very smooth.
Transfer the cheese mixture to a bowl. Dot the cheese in several spots with the algae powder and fold (rather than stir) the cheese over a few times to create swirls of blue-green color. Transfer the cheese to the lined form. Pack the mixture with the back of a spoon and smooth the surface as best you can. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a minimum of 8 hours. This will ensure that the coconut oil has completely solidified.
Lift the cheese from the container and slice or crumble as needed. Store the cheese wrapped in plastic wrap or in a zip-lock bag in the refrigerator. Because this cheese is made with miso, a fermented product, the flavor will continue to develop as it ages. Try aging the cheese for a minimum of one week before using for the best flavor.

719,https://veganuary.com/recipes/raw-spiced-apple-and-date-pie/,Raw Spiced Apple and Date Pie,"
Ingredients

For the crust:
200g macadamia or cashew nuts 
150g pecans or walnuts 
50g dates 
a large pinch of sea salt 
For the filling:
150g dried apples, roughly chopped 
480ml apple juice 
375g apples (about 3 or 4) 
1 tablespoon lemon juice 
8 big fat dates (medjool are ace), soaked until soft
½ teaspoon cinnamon 
a large pinch of nutmeg 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
1 tablespoon maple syrup 
a small pinch of sea salt 
For the topping:
90g pecans or walnuts, finely chopped 
4 big fat dates, finely chopped 
½ teaspoon vanilla extract 
a large pinch of ground cinnamon

","
Preparation
Makes 8 – 10 big slices.

Method

Soak the dried apples in the apple juice for an hour.


To make the crust, pulse all the ingredients in a blender until a rough crumble is formed. You will need to scrape down the sides with a spatula at least a couple of times. The crust is ready when it is sticky between your fingers – the fats will slowly be released as you blend the nuts. Gently press the crust down with your fingers into a shallow pie dish or plate roughly 23cm in diameter, with a loose bottom or springform action. Press down around the edge with a spoon to make it look neat and tidy, then pop into the fridge for 1 hour to firm up.


To make the filling, drain the dried apples, which should now be soft and plump. Core and chop the fresh apples, leaving the peel on, and toss them in the lemon juice to stop them going brown. Put half the fresh apples into a blender with the dates, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, maple syrup and salt, and pulse until well combined. Pour in a little of the apple juice from the dried apples if the filling is too thick. Add the rest of the fresh apples and dried apples, then spoon on to the pie crust and smooth out.


To make the topping, mix together the pecans, dates and vanilla in a bowl and spread over the top of the pie to form a nice crust. Sprinkle with the cinnamon.


Cover and place in the fridge for an hour to chill. Carefully slice and serve at room temperature

722,https://veganuary.com/recipes/shortcrust-cookies-murbeteigplatzchen/,Shortcrust cookies / Mürbeteigplätzchen,"
Ingredients

1 part = 100 grams sugar = 1/2 cup
2 parts = 200 grams fat (vegan butter or margarine) = 7/8 cup
3 parts = 300 grams flour = 2 cups + 1 tbl

","
Preparation
There is no source or reference for this recipe, it’s considered folk wisdom here. I learned it from Grandma who probably learned it from hers and so on. Some people refer to this dough as 1-2-3-Teig (1-2-3-Dough) because that’s how the ingredients are measured: one part sugar, two parts fat, three parts parts flour. These proportions refer to the weight of the ingredients, they don’t work with volume measurements. I converted the measurements for my standard recipe for you. It makes about 40 cookies (2 inches in diameter each):
1 part = 100 grams sugar = 1/2 cup
2 parts = 200 grams fat (vegan butter or margarine) = 7/8 cup
3 parts = 300 grams flour = 2 cups + 1 TBL
As you can see, there is no additional binding agent. Which is why this dough only works if you keep everything cold. Cold ingredients, cold kitchen supplies, cold hands. I mix it in a metal bowl that I cool under very cold water before use so even the mixing bowl is cold. The butter needs to be very cold and firm. If you’re using vegan margarine I recommend you put it in the freezer for an hour or so to make it firmer.

Method
Cut the very cold butter in chunks and place them in a cold, large bowl. Sift the flour over the butter chunks. Mix flour and butter chunks with your hands quickly, using your fingers to squish the butter chunks. Both ingredients will make a smooth dough in about a minute. Don’t knead too long, it gets crumbly very quickly.
When the flour and butter are just combined, add the sugar and knead in quickly. As soon as all ingredients are mixed, stop kneading. Form the dough into a roll of about 2 inches in diameter, firmly wrap the roll into cling film and keep it in the fridge for at least an hour. I keep it in a metal dish and add the knife I’m going to use to cut the cookies. That way, the knife is cold, too.
Set a timer so you don’t forget to preheat the oven to 180C/356F at least 15 minutes before the cooling time for the dough is over. Take the dough out of the fridge and unwrap. It will be very firm now. You can now cut the dough in even slices of about 0.4 cm / 1/16 inch.
Line a baking tray with parchment and even the edges of the cookies a bit with your fingers before you place them on the baking tray. I bake them in two batches, the dough makes about 40 cookies, they wouldn’t fit on one tray. Put the tray in the oven and bake for about 9-10 minutes. I start to watch the cookies after 8 minutes because they burn quickly. They will melt a little while baking. When the sides
start to brown, they’re done but still tender. Take the cookies from the baking tray quickly and let them cool on a cooling tray. Even if you work with two baking trays, it’s not enough to take the tray out of the oven. It’s still hot enough to burn the cookies after taking them out of the oven. They are still a little soft when they’re fresh from the oven and need to cool completely to firm up and turn crispy.
Done.
The one negative thing about those shortcrust cookies? They need to rest for a couple of days in a cookie jar or tin to reach their perfect texture.
Once you’ve mastered working with this shortcrust dough, the variations are endless:

Sprinkle them with sugar before baking.
Add lemon zest to the dough and cover the cookies with lemon icing after cooling.
Add chopped hazelnuts to the dough.
Stick two cookies together with a layer of homemade raspberry fudge in the middle. Dip those double decker cookies in dark chocolate and let them cool.

Guten Appetit!

Pour in the cream and whisk regularly so that the sauce becomes smooth. Gradually pour in the milk, whisking continuously so the sauce remains smooth. Season with pinches of salt and pepper, then add the nutritional yeast. Continue stirring until the sauce begins to thicken.
To build the lasagne, first add a few large spoonfuls of the tomato sauce to a large roasting dish and spread evenly. Then layer with 4 sheets of lasagne, followed by a few spoonfuls of bechamel. Next evenly spread 1/3 of the roasted vegetables on top. Repeat one more time starting again with a few spoonfuls of tomato sauce until you have 2 layers of lasagne sheets. Next later with a few spoonfuls of tomato sauce, 4lasagne sheets, and a few spoonfuls of bechamel. Next evenly spread the pesto over the bechamel and then layer with the remaining roasted vegetables. Finish with the last few spoonfuls of tomato sauce. Next sprinkle over the grated vegan cheese and finally spoon the remaining bechamel over the top. Spread the bechamel out evenly over the top of the lasagne.
Roast in the oven for 30-35 mins or until golden on top. Leave to sit for at least 10 mins before serving.

1 tblsp water
2 tblsp extra virgin olive oil 
1/2 tsp smoked paprika
1 clove garlic, crushed

Ingredients

30g pumpkin seeds
10 sun dried tomatoes (approx 40g)
20 pitted olives (I like to use kalamata)
30g / 1 bunch fresh basil, leaves picked
Juice of ½ lemon (organic if possible)
1 tbsp good olive oil

","
Method

Hydrate the sundried tomatoes in hot water and set aside.
Briefly blitz the pumpkin seeds in a food processor – I like to retain some of the texture, rather than create a powder.
Add the remaining ingredients to the pumpkin seeds and pulse until you have a paste. This is quite a thick pesto – if you want it to be more liquid, add more oil.
Store in a sterilised jar in the fridge. It should keep for at least a week.

728,https://veganuary.com/recipes/caramelised-onion-dip-with-hot-foccacia/,Caramelised Onion Dip with Warm Foccacia,"
Ingredients

For the Caramelized Onion Dip:
100g cashew nuts
The juice of 1½ lemons
1 large white onion
1 tbsp garlic oil 
1 tsp light soft brown sugar
For the Foccacia:
225g/8oz gluten free plain flour
4 tsp baking powder
¼ tsp xanthan gum
1 heaped tsp egg replacer, whisked together with 2 tbsp water 
250 ml hot water
1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
Stems of rosemary, optional
A pinch of sea salt flakes

","
Preparation

You will need a 9 ½ x 6 ½ inch/24cm x 16cm baking tin for this recipe


Method
Dip:
Place the cashew nuts in a bowl and cover with water, leave to soak overnight or for a minimum of 4 hours.
Once soaked, drain the cashews from the water and place in a high powered blender with the juice of 1 lemon and 100ml of water. Blitz together, stopping regularly to scrape down the sides, until you have a smooth and creamy consistency. You can do this in a food processor (the smaller the bowl the better) but it will take you a lot longer and you may find that the final result is a little grainier than it should be. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Next, peel and finely slice the onion into half moons. Heat the garlic oil into a heavy based frying pan until hot, add the sliced onion, the remaining lemon juice, a good pinch of sea salt and the brown sugar. Fry over a low heat until the onions are soft and caramelised – about 25 minutes.
Fold the onions into the cashew cream mixture until combined, season to taste and then chill until ready to use. This spread will last for up to 3 days if refrigerated.
Foccacia:
Preheat the oven to 200c and liberally grease the baking tin with olive oil. Place the flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, egg replacer and oil into a food processor, pour over of the water and blitz until you have a smooth and creamy dough – it should be dropping consistency but not completely liquid.
Alternatively, make up the egg replacer in a large mixing bowl, add the remaining dry ingredients, stir together and then add the remaining water, bit by bit, beating together until smooth and creamy.
Pour the mixture into the tin, level the top with the back of a spoon, pushing it into the corners of the tin and spreading it evenly. Now, use your fingertip to mark little dents and hills all over the dough – because it is such a liquid batter, you won’t be able to make solid holes, instead, just create little peaks and troughs in the surface of the bread. Now scatter over the rosemary leaves (if using), drizzle over the olive oil and sprinkle a little sea salt over the top.
Bake in the oven for 35 minutes or until just golden and crisp on top. Remove from the oven, turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool for a few minutes before serving.

730,https://veganuary.com/recipes/wicked-healthy-millionaire-caramel/,Millionaire Caramel Brownies,"
Ingredients
FOR THE BROWNIES:
2 tsp psyllium husk powder + 7 tsp water 175 g vegan butter
100g dark cocoa powder
1 tbsp espresso powder
300g caster sugar
90g plain flour
3/4 tsp flaky sea salt
4 tbsp plant milk
100g vegan dark choc chips (most chocolate over 64% cocoa is dairy-free)
FOR THE CARAMEL
170g vegan butter
200g golden syrup (corn syrup also works great)
170g soft dark brown sugar
100g caster sugar
150ml plant milk
1 tsp vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste
Pinch flaky sea salt
FOR THE CHOCOLATE:
200g vegan dark chocolate (minimum 60% cacao)
","
Method
To Make the Brownies

Preheat the oven to 170c. Line a brownie tray with baking parchment.
In a small bowl, mix the psyllium husk powder with the water and set aside.
In a medium saucepan over low heat, add the vegan butter and allow to melt completely.
To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the cocoa powder and the espresso powder and mix well. Add the melted butter along with the caster sugar and the psyllium egg mixture and beat well.
In a medium bowl, combine the flour and the salt. Add half of the flour mixture to the stand mixer and beat until combined. Add half of the plant milk and beat until combined. Add the remaining flour mixture and beat until combined followed by the remaining plant milk.
Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and add the chocolate chips. With a silicone spatula, mix until the chocolate chips are evenly distributed.
Pour or spoon the brownie batter into the prepared baking tray. Place in the oven and bake for 35 minutes. The edges should be quite firm but the centre will be a little jiggly when you remove it from the oven.
Place on a cooling rack and allow to cool fully to room temperature. Once cooled, chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

To Make the Caramel

In a large saucepan add all the caramel ingredients except for the vanilla and the salt. Place over a medium/low heat and stir with a heat-proof spatula until all the butter is melted and the sugars dissolved completely.
Using a probe thermometer, bring the caramel to 115c (you may have to increase the heat to get it there, but trust me, it will get there!).
Remove from the heat, add the vanilla and salt and stir continuously (off the heat!) for around 10 minutes while the caramel cools. It will thicken dramatically!
Once thick, set aside and allow to cool for a further 5-10 minutes (it should still be runny enough to pour or spoon over the chilled brownies, so keep checking the texture regularly).
Pour or spoon over the brownies in the tin, even out with your spoon and then return to the fridge for at least 30 minutes.

To Make the Chocolate

Chop the chocolate roughly into small pieces. Place in a medium heat-proof bowl and sit over a small pan of boiling water. Allow the steam from the water to heat the bowl and melt the chocolate, stirring constantly with a spatula.
Pour the chocolate over the chilled caramel and then set aside on the counter to set fully (not in the fridge). Once set, slice with a hot knife (otherwise the chocolate will crack) into squares or bars and serve!

731,https://veganuary.com/recipes/perfectly-vanilla-vegan-cupcakes/,Perfectly Vanilla Vegan Cupcakes,"
Ingredients

1 3/4 cups (260 grams) all purpose flour
3/4 cup + 1 Tb. (175 grams) granulated sugar
3/4 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. salt
1 cup unsweetened almond milk
1 Tb. apple cider vinegar
1 Tb. + 1 tsp. vanilla extract
1/2 cup canola oil (rapeseed oil)

Sweet Vanilla Frosting

2/3 cup non-hydrogenated vegetable shortening
2 cups powdered sugar (icing sugar)
2 Tb. unsweetened almond milk
1/8 tsp. salt

","
Preparation

First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Then, line 12 spots in a cupcake tin with paper liners.
In a small bowl, combine the wet ingredients: almond milk, apple cider vinegar, vanilla extract, and oil.  Set aside. You may notice the milk will start to curdle, but don’t worry! It’s suppose to.
In a separate medium-sized bowl, combine the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt. Stir well.
Slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients while stirring.  Make sure all flour is scraped from the sides and bottom of the bowl.  Be mindful to not over mix.
Spoon the batter into the cupcake liners just until they are about 3/4 full. Use a second cupcake tin with extra paper liners, if needed.
Bake on the top rack of your preheated oven for 19-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted down the center of each cupcake comes out clean with no batter. Allow them to sit in the tin for 5 minutes before carefully transferring them to a cooling rack.
 Cool completely before frosting, about 1 1/2 – 2 hours.
While the cupcakes cool, use this time to make your frosting. Using an electric stand or hand mixer, cream the shortening on a medium speed for about 30 seconds.
Then, add half of the powdered sugar and half of the almond milk and mix on high for about 30 seconds.
Next, add the salt and remaining sugar and almond milk.  Mix on high again for another 30 seconds. If you feel the frosting should be slightly thicker, add a spoonful or so more of powdered sugar.  For slightly thinner frosting, add a splash or two of almond milk – but be careful – a little goes a long way!
Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spoon or spatula and incorporate what was stuck to the sides into the frosting.
Frost cupcakes the old fashioned way with a butter knife or offset spatula, or place the frosting in a pastry bag fitted with a decorating tip!

Enjoy!

732,https://veganuary.com/recipes/vegan-cream-cheese/,Vegan Cream Cheese,"
Ingredients

*4 cups soya milk (Unsweetened) 946ml/32 oz 
2 tbsp lemon juice
1½ tsp sea salt
¾ tbsp apple cider vinegar
1 – 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
** 1/3 cup refined coconut oil
* this recipe only works with unsweetened soya milk
** use refined coconut oil to avoid your cheese being coconut flavoured

","
Method

Place a sieve over a deep pot or pan. Lay the cheese cloth in the sieve. I fold mine so it’s quadruple thickness. (You could use a thin, clean tea towel if you don’t have cheesecloth). This is where you will pour your milk to make the cheese when it is ready. It’s important that your pot is deep so the cheese doesn’t come into contact with the liquid.
In a large pan, over medium-high heat, simmer the soy milk until it reaches a light boil. Stir constantly with a whisk and watch the milk carefully so it does not boil over. It is important to continue stirring the entire time your milk is on the hob.
Once the soy milk comes to a light, rolling boil, add the lemon juice and stir. After about 30 seconds you should see some curdling start to occur (the solid of the milk will start to separate from the liquids).
Add the sea salt. Turn down the heat and stir for another minute or so. At this point your milk should be really curdled. You may see chunks or your curdled milk may be of a finer grain due to the whisk.
Stir in the nutritional yeast (dependent on how cheesy you want it to taste) and apple cider vinegar into the milk mixture and whisk lightly.
Pour the milk over the cheese cloth. Be careful because the milk will be very hot.
Tightly tie the cheesecloth at the top. Place a weight on top of the cheese cloth to help it drain faster and the cheese to solidify. Anything will do such as cans of food or a stack of ramekins.
Place in the fridge overnight. In the morning, the whey will have separated from the milk into the bottom bowl. Carefully unwrap your cheese.
Melt the coconut oil (20-30 seconds in the microwave on high will do). Put the cheese and oil in a blender and blend for around 30 seconds. It will be very thick but you just want to get an even texture. The oil gives the cheese the right ‘mouth feel’.
Transfer to a small dish, cover and refrigerate. This will last up to 2 weeks in the fridge.

200g strawberries, plus a few extra to decorate
100ml sunflower oil
100g golden caster sugar
4 tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 6 tbsp water
180g gluten free self raising flour
1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
For the vanilla buttercream icing:
55g dairy-free sunflower margarine – I always use Pure
30ml rice milk or other dairy-free milk
½ tsp vanilla extract
250g golden icing sugar

Preparation
Strawberries, raspberries, apples, even rhubarb would all work (the latter two would have to be cooked down with a little sugar first) and then topped with a generous spread of Vanilla Buttercream Icing.  They’re perfect for an afternoon tea or a children’s tea party.
Makes 12 Cupcakes

Method
Preheat the oven to 180c and line a 12 hole muffin or cupcake tray with paper cases.
Hull the strawberries and place in a mixing bowl.  Use a fork to mash the strawberries until pulpy and juicy.
Pour the oil into a large mixing bowl, add the sugar and beat together until combined.  Stir in the flaxseed and water mixture until combined (it will be slightly tacky in consistency).  Add the strawberries and flour and use a metal spoon to fold them into the mixture until mixed.
Spoon the mixture evenly into the cupcake cases, level the tops and bake in the oven for 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Meanwhile, make the buttercream icing.  Place the margarine, rice milk and vanilla extract into a mixing bowl, sift over half of the icing sugar and use an electric whisk to mix the ingredients together.  I recommend using an electric whisk as it takes some time to get the icing mixture to the right creamy consistency – about 4 minutes.  By all means do it by hand but it may take you much longer.  Sift in the remaining icing sugar and continue to whisk until thick, glossy and creamy.  Place the icing in the fridge to chill until ready to spread.
Once the cupcakes are completely cool, spread liberally with the icing and decorate with the fresh strawberries.

1 lb / 450g Maitake Mushroom clusters
1 Cup / 250ml Oil for frying
3 Cups / 375g Panko breadcrumbs
3 Cups / 375g Crumbled BBQ potato chips
3 Cups / 375g Flour
1 Tbsp salt, coarse grind Sea Salt
1 Tbsp poultry seasoning
1 Tbsp black pepper, fine grind
3 Cups / 360ml Follow Your Heart Vegan Egg wash mixture
1/2 Cup / 120ml hot sauce

","
Preparation
Serves 4

Method

Heat cast iron skillet or heavy-duty saucepan to med heat. On 1/2 sheet pan lay out all mushrooms in whole clusters, drizzle and lightly dab 1 t of oil to the mushrooms. Apply a light coat in which the seasoning will stick to, sprinkle dry seasoning then add to heated cast iron pan and weigh down with additional cast iron pan, a brick wrapped in tin foil or heavier cover to create a press. Cook for 2 -3 minutes then flip over being careful not to tear the mushroom breasts. Sprinkle a bit more of seasoning and then press with pan again. Repeat this process several times until mushrooms are condensed and pressed into light golden brown pieces with no liquid in the pan.

NOTE: Depending on the mushrooms (cause they’re all different) some will leach more liquid than others. Don’t fret it might take a couple minutes longer to cook but the liquid will dissipate. After they are pressed and golden, remove mushrooms from heat and cool.

In medium-size bowl or container add pressed shrooms and Haute sauce to marinate for at least an hour or overnight.
In three separate bowls get the breading station ready.

Seasoned flour with a little salt and pepper
Make Vegan egg wash mixture by following directions on Follow Your Heart Vegan Egg
Make panko crumb crust by adding panko, BBQ potato chips, and seasoning to food processor and pulse until coarse grind consistency.


Lightly dredge each piece of shroom, first in flour to coat, then in vegan egg mixture, then in seasoned panko, so it’s fully coated.
In medium cast iron pan add oil so it’s between 1/4 & 1/2-inch deep and heat on medium heat, once hot begin to fry each piece for several minutes on each side until golden brown, when done let sit on newspaper or paper bag to catch excess oil.

NOTE: if you’re doing a big batch and allow to cool – pieces may be reheated before serving by assembling on a baking sheet and reheat in a 350-degree oven for 5 – 10 minutes until hot.

For the buttermilk:
1 cup vegan buttermilk (1 cup of soya milk and 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, whisked together and left to sit for 5 – 10 mins)
1 tsp hot sauce
Pinch of salt
Oil for frying

","
Preparation
Make the seitan following the instructions below:

There are loads of recipes for seitan and I am working my way through them, learning as I go. For this recipe I tried one by Isa Chandra (Chicken Stylee Seitan, available on thePPK.com) and because it was a big batch I tried a couple of different ways of cooking it. I think either way would work and I would definitely try the boiled method for this recipe next time.


I followed the recipe by Isa Chandra up to the point of cooking. At that point, I separated the seitan dough in to two batches. With one, I followed the recipe, gentry cooking the seitan in stock. This was the most successful of my attempts so far. It is really, really important not to let it boil. I got all tech about it and dragged out the jam thermometer. I kept it between 94 and 98 degrees.


Anyway, for this particular version, I took the other half of the seitan and formed it in to small nuggets. Keep them on the small side because they will expand on cooking. I put them on an oiled baking tray and covered them with tin foil and baked for 20 – 30 mins at 180oC. Keep an eye on them, they are only small so it won’t take much to burn them. My thinking with this was that it keep them dry and therefore make the coating stick better.


If you have the time, the stock method would work too but you would want to leave them to drain for quite a while and get as much stock out of them as you can before trying to do the coating.


If you don’t fancy making your own seitan or you have your own preferred product or recipe, you could just use that. If you are still searching for that perfect recipe, give Isa’s recipe a go.


Method

You will need 2 bowls and a drying rack to complete all of the coating process and to also drain off the seitan once cooked.


Start off by making the vegan butter milk. Combine the ingredients and then let sit for 5 to 10 mins whilst you get all the ingredients for the flour together and mix them well in a bowl. By the time you have got them all sorted, your buttermilk should be good to go.


In your second bowl, mix the buttermilk with the hot sauce and salt. You are now ready to being the coating process.


Add the seitan to the buttermilk and let soak for 10 mins. One soaked, add the pieces a few at a time to the flour and coat well before putting on the drying rack and leaving for another 5 to 10 mins. You can use this time to get your oil heated up. You want it at 180oC. Be careful, don’t burn your house down or anything.


Once the seitan pieces have sat in the coating for 10 mins, we repeat the coating process. This helps more of the flour stick and also creates all sort of lumps, bumps and crevices which are going to make this really good. Straight in to the buttermilk, straight in to the flour and then in to the 180oC oil.


The most important tip I found was to leave the pieces along for at least 3 minutes otherwise you risk knocking the coating off. Overall mine took about 8 mins to get nice and golden. My pan was not big enough to cook the whole lot and yours probably won’t be either so I did a couple of batches and kept the first batch warm in a low oven. I chucked the first batch in the oil again for a minute at the end, just because.

738,https://veganuary.com/recipes/gazpacho/,Gazpacho,"
Ingredients

500g large heirloom or vine tomatoes (that’s about 6 large or about 12 regular sized tomatoes)
1 small red onion
1 small cucumber
The juice of 1 orange
The juice of 1 lemon
1 clove garlic
2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
2 tbsp olive oil
A small bunch of fresh parsley
A small bunch of fresh coriander
4 soaked pitted dates
1 tsp ground cumin
A small pinch of chilli powder

","
Preparation
This recipe also calls for soaked dates: I recommend you cover the dates in a little boiling water (just enough to cover) for an hour before making. Alternatively you can use medjool dates (don’t forgot to remove the stones!) which are much softer and also larger, so halve the number required.  It’s also really nice to use a mix of tomatoes if you can – yellow, red, plum, cherry, heirloom etc. It just looks so beautiful in the bowl, but if you can only get standard tomatoes then I recommend going for a mix of large and cherry, all on the vine for added flavour.

Method

Place half of the tomatoes (choose the prettier ones to chop up later) into a blender with the juice of the orange and lemon, clove of garlic, cider vinegar, dates, cumin, chilli and oil.
Blitz until completely smooth and then add the fresh herbs and pulse very briefly until just incorporated -if you blend the herbs too long the gazpacho will turn brown instead of a rich red colour.
Finely dice the remaining tomatoes, cucumber and onion.  Place in a large mixing bowl and then pour the blended mixture over the top.
Season to taste, stir well and refrigerate for as long as possible before serving – if you make this the day before and leave in the fridge overnight you’ll find that the flavours really develop.
To serve, pour the gazpacho into bowls and top with a drizzle of good quality olive oil.

12 large tomatoes, or use 2 tins of chopped tomatoes
2 tbsp tomato puree
2 aubergines
1 carrot, diced
4 cloves of garlic
1 stick of celery, diced
1 large onion, diced
1 red pepper
Dark soy sauce, 2 tbsp
Vegetable stock, 1 pt good quality vegetable bouillion works best
Small sprig of fresh thyme, 2 bay leaves and handful of fresh marjoram
400ml almond or soy milk
2 tbsp plain flour
40g vegan margarine
120g grated hard vegan cheese such as vegan parmesan
1 packet of egg free lasagne pasta
Black pepper, white pepper and sea salt

","
Method
Sauté 1/2 of the onion and one clove of crushed garlic in olive oil until softened. Add puy lentils, sauté for a further minute then add 1 1/2 to 2 pints of stock and simmer until lentils are fully cooked and soft. Add further stock as needed. You are aiming for them to absorb most of the liquid without leaving too much broth.
 
Remove the hard core of the tomatoes and place whole on a baking tray, along with 3 garlic cloves. Roast on high heat until well roasted and starting to blacken. Blitz with handblender. Set aside.
 
Remove ends and slice aubergines lengthways, approx 1.5cm thickness. Drizzle with olive oil and salt and pepper. Roast on high heat until golden brown and soft. Set aside.
 
Sauté the remaining onion, carrot, red pepper, and celery, then add cooked lentils, soy, one bay leaf, a handful of fresh marjoram, and a sprig of thyme. Add blended tomato sauce (or tinned tomatoes and garlic if using) and the tomato puree. Bring to boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper, then taste to check seasoning and adjust according to taste.
 
Heat butter in a small pan, add a pinch of salt and plain flour and cook to make a roux, gently cooking the paste for 2-3 minutes. Then slowly add milk, whisking all the time until reach a creamy consistent sauce. Add a bay leaf, and simmer for 2 minutes.
 
Layer some bechamel sauce on the bottom of a large deep baking dish and cover with pasta. Then layer over lentil and tomato mix, followed by a layer of roasted aubergine, allowing the aubergine to overlap to create a nice thick layer. Add another layer of lentil mix and then top with another layer of pasta, on top of the pasta pour creamy béchamel sauce. Sprinkle top with cheese and salt and pepper.
 
Bake in a medium hot oven at 190 C for 30-40 mins until bubbling and top is golden brown. Serve with a fresh green salad.

Ingredients

1 bag of fresh Kale
Nutritional Yeast Flakes
Rapeseed oil
Salt

","
Method

Put oven on a low heat.
Have a large oven tray lined with paper, or a non stick sheet ready.
If you don’t grow your own then buy a bag of fresh kale. Wash well and take out as many of the tough stalks as you can. Drain but no need to dry.
In a large deep frying pan put all your kale it will seem a lot but it will soon go down in size. Put about a tablespoonful of rapeseed oil over the kale, and stir fry over a high heat until soft.
Add a sprinkle of salt and toss.
Add nutritional yeast flakes 2 – 3 tablespoons, and stir in..
Now spread on to the oven tray and place in the oven. Check after 10 minutes and turn kale over as it should be starting to crisp up.
Place back in the oven and keep checking, putting the outside kale into the middle as this speeds up the crisping.
Store when cool in an air tight container… if you can resist that is!

","
Method

Firstly, line the cake tin with a sheet of cling film, laying it as smoothly as possible inside the tin.
Next, place the walnuts, coconut and cocoa powder into a food processor and pulse until of a fine breadcrumb consistency.
Add the dates and the pinch of sea salt and continue to pulse, and then add the minimum amount of water, pulsing as you go, until the mixture combines and pulls together.  You can add the remaining water if you feel like the mixture isn’t holding together.
Transfer the base mixture into the cake tin and press down lightly with your fingers to spread it over the base of the tin, then, using a spoon, smooth out the top layer of the mixture so that it forms an even base.
Place in the fridge and leave to chill while you make the topping.
Place the cocoa powder, maple syrup and coconut oil in a blender – I recommend using a high powered blender instead of a food processor as it will give you a creamier result.
Blitz the ingredients until you have a completely smooth, creamy filling – this may take a few minutes.
Pour the chocolate ganache filling over the base of the tart, level the top with the back of a spoon and then chill in the fridge for at least 3 hours before serving.

A little tip, when ready to serve, run a large knife under the hot tap before slicing the tart, repeat for every slice as this will give you the smoothest, leanest slices of tart.

240g/8½oz chickpeas (or 1 tin drained)
300g/10oz sweet potatoes (or 1 medium sized)
2 large cloves garlic
1 handful fresh coriander leaves
¼ teaspoon ground cardamon
heaped teaspoon ground turmeric (or 1 heaped tablespoon of freshly grated)
2 teaspoons heaped ground coriander
1 teaspoon heaped ground cumin
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 heaped teaspoon sea salt
2 tablespoons gram flour (chickpea flour)
Extra gram flour for rolling with

","
Method

Scrub and chop the sweet potato and boil until soft with skin still included (approximately 10 minutes). Then drain and place in a mixing bowl.
Crush garlic and chop along with coriander leaves (as small as you can) with a sharp knife.
Add all ingredients into blender or food processor (EXCEPT the gram flour). I find this actually works best  with a hand (immersion) blender. With a hand blender, you can apply downward pressure and get in there nicely… if you use a jug blender or food processor it will work fine if you keep scraping down the sides and loosen the mixture. Alternatively you could go for the real rustic effect and use a strong potato masher to do the job instead. Blend until most of the mixture is broken down. It doesn’t need to be totally smooth; it can be quite rustic.
Once blended add the gram flour and continue to mix in with a spoon. If you leave it on the side for a while (half and hour or half a day) then it will firm up a little making it slightly easier to roll. I sometimes let it stand if I have time, but that’s not essential.
 Chickpea moisture varies from batch to batch. The mixture should be soft and pliable, easy to roll into a ball in your hands. Take a heaped teaspoon worth of mixture and roll a small ball (this should be smaller than a golf ball). The delightful yellowness glow of the turmeric will rub off a bit on your hands. If you’d rather now yellow-out your hands then use extra gram flour to roll with. If your mixture is too soft to roll well, then add a little extra gram flour or use gram flour to roll in.
Place on a lightly oiled baking tray and bake in preheated oven at gas mark 6 or 7 (200˚C to 220˚C/ 400˚F to 425˚F) for approximately 30 minutes or until tanned.
Enjoy!

Ingredients

All listed in the Cooking Instructions

","
Method
The basics:
Gravy – Good gravy is a must. It ties everything together and is essential for mashing roasties into! This is my ‘go-to’ recipe:

Chop an onion and two/three cloves of garlic and chuck into a pan with a splash of olive oil and a large bay leaf or a good sprinkling of thyme
Once softened, add a generous teaspoon of Dijon mustard, and about the same of tomato puree
Chop up some kalamata olives or sundried tomatoes (a good handful and you can do both if you want) into little pieces and add to the pot
Add a dash of soy sauce, and a good shake of smoked paprika (optional)
Boil kettle and add enough water to the pot to suit number of guests
Add as many teaspoons of Bouillon to match the hot water
Stir all the time!
Let it simmer down until thick. I typically start a roast by boiling my potatoes for roasties (see below), and then start straight on my gravy, so it should have had enough time to thicken by the time it comes to serving. If you need to thicken it some more, just add a little cornstarch or flour (only a little at a time)
Remove bay leaf (if using) before serving

Gravy additions: I have been known to add to this recipe by adding celery (after the onions and garlic), chopped cherry tomatoes, green olives, tapenade, extra onion, mushrooms, leeks, Marmite etc. Have fun with it! Anything that adds that umami flavour is always good. And if you want to easily increase the protein then add some lentils to the gravy – puy or green work best – or even beans (I like black beans!). Make it in your own signature style 🙂
Roast Potatoes – Forget everything else, what makes a roast is roasties! Loved by everyone, great cold later on, or in a Spanish omelette the next day. I keep mine really simple…

Cut potatoes into roastie-sized chunks. Leave the skin on!
Boil until the skin starts to slightly peel off and the potatoes are soft
Pour potatoes into roasting tin (I often shove mine into the oven a few minutes before, so the oil sizzles when I pour them in) with a little olive oil, a little salt, lots of cracked pepper and either rosemary or thyme. (I have been known to use smoked paprika here too, or throw in a handful of garlic cloves – again, add the flavours that you love.)
Leave in oven at about 220C for about 40 minutes, or for however long it takes for them to crisp up just as you like them.

Carrots/Broccoli/Green Beans/Kale etc. – Great for crunch, colour and texture. You can cook these any way you want really, but for carrots, broccoli and beans I like to flash boil so they remain full of bite. None of those soggy veggies your Nana used to serve! Kale is great with a touch of oil in a pan, lots of pepper and sometimes a little garlic. If serving as a side, it is also lovely with some toasted sunflower seeds or pine nuts sprinkled on top.
The Crowd Pleasers:
Lentil loaf – I absolutely love this, and it is perfect with all the roasted trimmings! A great option for Christmas or Thanksgiving, and is excellent cold the next day – have it in a sandwich! In my mind, there’s no need to reinvent wheels if someone has already made the perfect dish… and Vegan Richa has. I recommend you try this as soon as you can! (It is also a protein-packed hit and a half! I have yet to meet an omnivore who doesn’t love this.)

Vegan Richa’s Lentil and Quinoa Loaf 

Roasted Cauliflower – Having never been a huge fan of cauliflower, I was initially sceptical about this. But the jungle drums are not lying… You simply have to try it! Easy, delicious, different, fun and extremely tasty; it is a great one to knock out for non-vegans. I have used this recipe from One Green Planet and been overjoyed with it every time:
‘Cheesy’ Whole Roasted Cauliflower
Garlicky Roasted Sprouts – Sprouts get a bad rap, and I don’t think that’s fair. When cooked right they can be sensational. I make this at Christmas as well as whenever I randomly happen to pick up sprouts, and it’s always a winner. I use a whole bag of sprouts for this.

Wash your sprouts, chop the hard ends off and score an X in the bottom of each
Into an oven-proof dish, add the sprouts (you can choose to cut them up a little here, or wait until later as I do), a good glug of olive oil, about the same of water, minced/finely chopped garlic (minimum of three cloves), a little salt and lots of cracked pepper
Put them in the oven at about 220C and check on them in about 20 mins
You may need to add a little more water when you next check in them. Give the sprouts a good mix up and, if they’re softening, mush a few up with the back of your spoon. This dish is great when you have a mix of whole sprouts and broken up bits
Put back in the oven for approximately another 20 minutes – you may want to check, stir and mush about 10/15 mins in, just to ensure they’re not burning.
You sort of have to decide when these sprouts are right for you. Some people like them really caramelised, others less so. So, again, it is a play around with kind of dish. I once thought I’d completely ruined this, as I’d burnt the outer edges of the sprouts early on, but I mixed them up, added a bit more water, mashed them a little and kept going. Everyone at the table loved them and had seconds. Best idea, however, is to do what I don’t do… Make these once before the special occasion so you feel confident on the day!

Quick and Easy:
Sometimes you don’t have lots of time and that’s when mock meats are just ace. Gravy, roast potatoes, some greens and one of these (or similar) and that’s a roast in my book!

Fry’s Sausages, Pies, or Thick Cut Strips – Great to have in the freezer! Whip up a load of veg and add one of these great products to the mix. Perfect for family meals with non-vegans 🙂
Linda McCartney Sausages – Comfort food for vegetarians and vegans alike, both the Original and Rosemary flavours are vegan.
Granose Burger Mix – I love this stuff! One sachet makes four patties, and two for each plate seems to work well.

Ingredients

For the honeycomb:
5 tbsp granulated sugar
2 tbsp golden syrup
½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
For the parfait:
200g dark, dairy-free chocolate
150g dairy-free margarine or coconut oil (at room temperature)
2 tbsp golden syrup
85g blanched almonds, or use the same weight in favourite gluten free, vegan biscuits if you can’t have nuts, or stem ginger instead for extra flavour
85g glace cherries
100g dried cranberries

","
Preparation

Serves 8
You will need a 450g/1lb loaf tin for this recipe


Method
Begin by making the honeycomb. Generously grease a flat baking tray with vegetable oil. Melt the granulated sugar and golden syrup in a high sided saucepan over a low heat. Once melted, turn up the heat a little and bubble the syrup until it turns to a rich, caramel gold colour. Whisk in the bicarbonate of soda – this will make the syrup foam up, hence the high sided pan – and immediately pour the mixture onto your greased baking tray. Set the tray aside and leave it to cool for 20 minutes, before sliding the honeycomb off and chopping it roughly into small chunks for the parfait.
Next, line the loaf tin with enough cling film to allow it to drape over the edges by about 3 inches, smoothing the cling film into the tin to form a crease free base.
Break up the dark chocolate and roughly chop the almonds. Place the chocolate, golden syrup and margarine in a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water, stir together until melted and combined to a smooth and glossy finish.
Take the bowl off the heat and stir in the chopped honeycomb, almonds, cherries and cranberries. Spoon the mixture into the lined tin and level the top. Fold the overhanging cling film loosely over the top of the parfait and then place in the freezer for 1 hour, remove from the freezer and transfer the parfait to the fridge until set. Once ready to serve, carefully lift the parfait from the tin, unwrap the cling film and cut into 2 cm slices to serve.

772,https://veganuary.com/recipes/jackfruit-ceviche/,Jackfruit Ceviche,"
Ingredients

1 can (20 oz) green jackfruit in water or brine
½ cup peeled and small diced tomato
½ cup peeled, seeded and small diced cucumber
¼ cup small diced onion
¼ cup chopped cilantro
1 clove garlic, minced
1 small Serrano chili, seeded and finely minced
Juice of 1 lime
1 tbsp olive oil
½ tsp fine sea salt or kosher salt, or more to taste
¼ tsp coarse ground black pepper
¼ tsp ground cumin
½ ripe but firm avocado, diced

","
Preparation
Canned green jackfruit bears a resemblance to flaked crabmeat when cooked. It can be found in Indian and Asian markets or purchased through the internet. Look for the label “Green Jackfruit” or “Young Green Jackfruit” and be sure that it’s packed in water or brine and not syrup. Cans of ripe jackfruit packed in syrup may be stocked nearby, but don’t be tempted to substitute as the ripe fruit will be too sweet for this application.
*Chef’s note: Traditional ceviche made with fresh seafood has a fresh, clean flavor and should not be fishy. If you wish to add a subtle ocean flavor to this plant-based version add a little bit of dried kelp flakes or flaked, toasted nori.

Method
Drain the jackfruit and rinse. If the jackfruit was canned in brine, rinse thoroughly. Add the chunks of jackfruit to 1 quart salted boiling water. Reduce the heat to a slow boil and cook for 15 minutes. Drain in a colander and let cool. When cool enough to handle, remove the tough core from each chunk of jackfruit with a sharp knife and discard. Break the chunks apart with your fingers and remove the soft seeds and seed membranes and discard. The remaining flaky pulp is the only portion you will want to use in the dish, so sort through the chunks carefully (there will be a significant amount of unusable material). Wrap the pulp in a lint-free kitchen towel and squeeze to remove excess water. Coarsely chop the pulp and place in a mixing bowl.
Add the remaining ingredients EXCEPT for the avocado and toss well to combine. Refrigerate for several hours to marinate the ingredients and blend the flavors. Add the diced avocado just before serving and toss well. The avocado can also be placed into a ring mold and the ceviche layered on top for a lovely presentation. Season the ceviche with additional salt as desired and to taste. Serve with crunchy tortilla chips.
Tip: Strips of flour or corn tortilla that have been flash-fried in cooking oil make an interesting and crunchy garnish.

120ml plant milk alternative 
350g demerara sugar 
115g vegan spread or butter alternative 
2 tsp vanilla bean extract or vanilla extract 
 
","
Method
Line a 20cm square cake tin with baking parchment. Set aside.
Place the ingredients into a large non-stick saucepan and melt over a low heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves. 
We like to add a little pinch of salt to the caramel which you can do at the beginning of this step. 
Bring to the boil then simmer for 5-8 minutes, stirring continuously and scraping the base of the pan. Take care while the mixture boils and during stirring as the fudge will be VERY hot! To see if it’s ready, drop a little of the mixture into a jug of ice-cold water. A soft ball of fudge should form. 
Alternatively, check with a sugar thermometer if you have one (the fudge should be approximately 112-115°C). 
Remove the fudge from the heat and leave to cool for 5 minutes. Beat the mixture until it loses its shine and becomes very thick (this should take about 10 minutes).  You’ll have a dead arm but it’s worth it for the best ever vegan fudge! 
You can add chopped chocolate, nuts, stem ginger, cookie pieces, alcohol, flavouring extracts whatever you like to the fudge after its cooled and then beat as usual. 
Press into the prepared tin with the back of a spoon and leave to set before cutting into squares. 
The fudge will keep for up to 2 weeks in an airtight container at room temperature.

1 tbsp maple syrup
4 tbsp soy
1 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 tsp liquid smoke
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp chilli flakes
For the squash:
1 squash (I used butternut, but acorn squash would also be great)
2 tsp maple syrup
1 tsp coconut oil (solid)
1 tsp cinnamon

1 tbsp peanut butter
1 red chilli
3 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves picked
2 tbsp white miso
1 tsp maple syrup
2 tbsp soy
½ lime (juice)
2 tbsp water
 

","
Preparation
Serves two to three as a main meal
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 60 minutes
 

Method

At least 2 hours in advance: prepare the bacon by slicing the tempeh as thinly as you can and coat it with the marinade ingredients.
Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F / Gas Mark 6.
To prepare the squash, use a sharp knife to top and tail it and then cut lengthways down the middle. Scoop out the seeds and stringy bits using a spoon. Slice a criss-cross pattern across the flesh and drizzle the maple syrup and oil onto each half, followed by the seasoning.
Cook for 45 minutes to an hour. It should turn a lovely caramelised brown, and be soft, but not mushy. Once cooked, slice into chunks.
Combine the chickpeas, oil and seasoning in an oven proof dish and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure even cooking.
Arrange the tempeh bacon slices on a flat tray, lined with parchment paper, and pour over any remaining marinade. Place the tray in the oven and cook for 20-30 minutes, turning once.
While the squash, chickpeas and tempeh are cooking, prepare the freekeh by simmering in water for 15 minutes. Drain and set aside. Heat the oil in a large pan and sautée the garlic, mushrooms and thyme until lightly browned. Add the freekeh, stir and take off the heat.
Once the oven-cooked ingredients are almost done, slice the greens into ribbons and steam until soft. Rehydrate the wakame according to the packet and slice thinly. Slice the tomatoes.
To make the dressing, combine all the ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth.
You’re now ready to assemble the bowl! I like to start with the freekeh and greens, then layer in sections, finishing with the dressing.

Ingredients
For the Bolognese sauce
250g tempeh
250g field mushrooms or any other is fine
1 stick celery finely chopped
1 medium carrot finely chopped
1 onion finely chopped
4 cloves garlic
20g tomato puree
200ml red wine
1 canned chopped tomatoes or 400g
300ml passata
100ml water
Few sprigs rosemary and thyme finely chopped
","
Method

Start to pulse the mushrooms as they need to be pureed. Remove and place into a bowl.
Do the same to the tempeh, but this needs to be a bit chunkier. Place it in with the mushrooms.
Add the mushroom and tempeh into the pan, turn the heat up to cook out the mushroom water. This will do two things: give a deep colour and intensify the flavours.
Once the mushroom water has been cooked out and evaporated, transfer the mix out of the pan and drain in the colander.
In the same large pan, add some olive oil. Add the finely chopped veggies and cook slowly, releasing all those beautiful aromas and flavours. Then in with the garlic and cook for a further 2-3mins.
Add the finely chopped thyme and rosemary and continue to cook for a few minutes.
Go in with the tomato puree, cook out slowly for 3 mins. Finely add the red wine and turn the heat up to deglaze the pan with all the caramelized sediment that’s on the bottom of the pan – this is where all the natural flavour is.
Reduce to cook out the alcohol and add the tempeh and mushroom mixture back into the pan. Give the mix a good stir.
Add the canned tomatoes, passata and water. Give it a good stir.
Season with salt and pepper cook for 10 mins.
Have a pan of boiling water ready to cook the pasta. Mix and emulsify the Bolognese sauce with the cooked pasta.
Finish with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast.
Serve and enjoy!

Ingredients
Makes 2 French Toast
3 tbs of self-raising flour
330 ml of chocolate flavoured Bright Barley Drinks (or similar)
1 pinch of salt
1 pinch of cinnamon
4 pieces of bread
For the nut-ella (makes a 700 gram jar)
300 grams hazelnuts (lightly toasted)
250 ml coconut oil
3–4 tablespoons maple syrup
3 tablespoons cacao powder
1/2 vanilla pod (bean), scraped, or 1/2 teaspoon ground vanilla pod
Toppings
banana
strawberries
cinnamon dusting
fresh berries
maple syrup
","
Method
Start with the nut-ella
Place the hazelnuts in a preheated oven 180 degrees for 10 minutes. This way they get lightly toasted and release fat so they can easily be made into nut butter.
Put in a blender and blitz until fine. Start on the low setting and work your way up. Then add the rest of the ingredients and blend to a smooth chocolate paste.
Spoon into a clean glass jar or container and set aside.
For the French toast
In a small bowl, whisk together the plant milk, flour, cinnamon and pinch of salt.
Place the bread in a shallow dish (with sides) that holds all of the bread. Pour the batter over the bread or dip, then lift or flip it over to make sure both sides are evenly coated.
Heat a drizzle of coconut oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add the bread slices and cook for a few minutes each side until golden brown.
To make it look pretty, arrange your toast slices and serve scattered with fresh berries, banana slices and big generous dollops of home-made nut-ella!

1/2 cup cocoa powder
1 cup apple puree (2 cored apples blended) 
1/2 cup berry juice (i.e cranberry juice)*  
1/2 tsp pure stevia
1 heaped cup of mixed frozen berries- for top (use frozen so the fruit does not burn)

Preparation
Serves 4 – 6.

Method

Blend the apples until smooth, add the stevia and cocoa powder. Mix through the flour and starch and lastly the juice to form a smooth thick batter.
Spoon the batter into a 8″ cake tin and roughly smooth the top. Pile the frozen berries on top of the batter and lightly press.

Preheat oven to 180C (350F).
Use an ice cream scoop to scoop out dough onto a baking paper lined baking tray to create 8-9 cookies. Gently flatten with the palm of your hand (they will spread a little whilst they cook).
Bake in the preheated oven for 10 -12 minutes (until golden!)… 12 minutes for a firmer cookie but it really does depend on your oven!
Allow to cool on the tray for 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool fully…or serve the up warm with ice cream of choice… I’d opt for my Vanilla Bean Dream Ice Cream.
Once cool store in a seal tight container at room temperature for up to four days or freeze for up to one month.

798,https://veganuary.com/recipes/lemony-courgette-soup-with-mint-pesto/,Lemony Courgette Soup with Mint Pesto,"
Ingredients

2 tbsp olive oil
2 white onions
1kg large courgettes, a mix of yellow and green preferably organic and not too young.
1 bay leaf
1 ½ tsp herbs de Provence
½ tsp mustard powder
750ml vegetable stock
1 unwaxed lemon
Salt and pepper to season
¼ of a nutmeg plus more for serving
For the pesto:
25g fresh mint, leaves picked
2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped
60g pine nuts
6 tsp olive oil
1 tsp nutritional yeast
¼ tsp salt

","
Preparation
Serves 4
 

Method

Finely chop the onions. Using a heavy based, lidded pan heat 2 tbsp of olive oil and add the onions giving them a quick stir so they get coated in the oil. Pop the lid on the pan and, keeping the heat low, sweat the onion for around 10 mins, stirring occasionally, until translucent. While the onion is cooking you can prepare the courgettes. Give them a wash, and cut away any damaged skin. Slice each courgette in half lengthways and slice into ¼ inch pieces. When the onions are cooked, add the courgettes, bay leaf, herbs de Provence and mustard powder, give them a good stir, and balance the lid back on the pan so it is slightly ajar. The cooking time here will vary a little depending on the size of the courgettes but this should be around 20-25 minutes with the courgettes taking on a translucent appearance when they are cooked.
While the courgettes are cooking, make the pesto. Using a food processor or a pestle and mortar blend together the pine nuts, garlic, mint and 4 tsp of the olive oil. Once a coarse paste is formed add the salt and the nutritional yeast. Give another quick blend so the new ingredients are integrated but the texture of the pesto remains coarse.
Once the courgettes are cooked, add the vegetable stock and grate in the nutmeg. Keeping the pan on a low heat stir well for a minute or two before transferring the contents to the blender (or leave in the pan if using a hand blender). Puree the soup adding some hot water if the soup is too thick, and return to the pan.
Zest the lemon. Cover the zest as it dries out incredibly quickly and set aside until serving. Disposing of any pips, squeeze the juice into the hot soup. Give a quick stir and check the seasoning.
To serve, ladle the soup into the serving bowls and grate over a little nutmeg. Rest a dollop of pesto on top of the soup then scatter over the lemon zest.

Ingredients

For the grilled pears:
2 pears
Coconut sugar
Pinch of ground cinnamon
Pinch of ground cloves
Pinch of ground nutmeg
For the porridge:
80g porridge oats
300ml your favourite non dairy milk
approx. 50ml water
1 apple
1/2tsp cinnamon
Pinch of ground cloves
Pinch of ground nutmeg
For topping:
1 tbsp hazelnuts
1 tbsp pumpkin seeds

","
Preparation

Wash the pears, slice in half lengthways and scoop out the core. Place on a baking tray and sprinkle with the sugar and spices. Grill the pears for around 20-25 minutes whilst you prepare the porridge.


Place a saucepan on a low-medium heat and add the oats, spices and milk.


Wash the apple and grate it before adding it to the saucepan straight away before it browns. Stir the porridge well whilst it cooks to ensure you get a nice creamy porridge.


Whilst the porridge cooks, heat a frying pan on a high heat and add the hazelnuts. Shake occasionally to prevent burning until the skins start to peel away. Transfer onto some kitchen towel and leave to cool slightly before rubbing in the towel to remove the skins. Meanwhile toast the pumpkin seeds in the frying pan, shaking the pan until they start to pop then transfer into a bowl to cool.


When the porridge starts to thicken you may need to add some water, up to 50ml to get your preferred consistency. (I always find how much liquid you require can vary quite dramatically depending on what oats you use). After 15-20 minutes you should have perfect creamy porridge ready to serve.


Chop the toasted hazelnuts and sprinkle over along with the pumpkin seeds. Finally top with the grilled pears.

801,https://veganuary.com/recipes/chocolate-blueberry-lovehearts/,Chocolate Blueberry Lovehearts,"
Ingredients
Chocolate ingredients:
50g (1¾ oz) raw cocoa butter
50g (1¾ oz) raw cocoa powder
3 tablespoons raw coconut sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Filling ingredients:
70g (2¼oz) fresh blueberries
40g (1½oz) coconut butter
1 medjool date (pitted)
","
Preparation

You will need: A heart-shaped chocolate mould with 12 hearts. You can use any chocolate mould shape if you’d prefer a different shape.
You can also watch a video demonstration of chocolate making


Method
Step One:
‘Shave’ the solid cocoa butter with a sharp knife or grater. Shaving is just really thin slicing that makes the cocoa butter crumble. The finer you can get it, the easier it will be to melt. You can leave it in big chunks if you like, but be prepared to wait a while for it to melt.
Step Two: 
Melt the cocoa butter. You can do this by leaving it in a warm place in a heat proof glass bowl by a fire or directly above a hot radiator. It melts at 34˚C. The idea is to melt it, rather than cook it, maintaining its ‘un-cookedness’. If you don’t have a gentle heat source then use a hob or stove.
Put the cocoa butter in a small, oven proof, glass bowl and then put that bowl in a pan containing an inch or so of really hot water. Keep the hob/stove burning on a low heat. The heat will then transfer through the bowl, enough to melt the cocoa butter. Give it frequent stirs to assist the melting process. Don’t keep it on the heat any longer than it takes to melt it.
The best time to use it is when it has just melted. If it is too hot, then it takes longer to cool down and the coconut sugar will sink to the bottom of the chocolate when added.
Step Three: 
Add the coconut sugar to the melting cocoa butter during step two. The melting cocoa butter will help to soften and dissolve the sugar.
Step Four: 
When the cocoa butter has finally melted, mix in the cocoa powder and any other remaining ingredients.
Here’s the fun part!
Making chocolate hearts:
Place 1 teaspoon of your melted chocolate mixture into each heart-shaped well. When you’ve put some in every heart, pop them into the freezer whilst you prepare and blend the filling ingredients.
Prepare the filling:
Blend all the filling ingredients together thoroughly and leave on the side whilst you make the chocolate.
Making chocolate hearts continued:
Take your hearts out of the freezer (after about 10 minutes worth of chilling) and place the blueberry filling into each one. This is slightly fiddly! Use a teaspoon and a knife to help the process…
Take about ½ a teaspoon of filling and gently dollop it on top of the freshly chilled chocolate hearts. Aim right for the middle of the heart. You’ll find that some always hits the edges… simply tease it back with your knife to create a thin gap at the edges (you’ll see why next).
Take the rest of your melted chocolate (you should have some left – if not – make some more) and pour 2 or 3 teaspoons over each dollop. Place your tray of hearts straight into the freezer to help your chocolates set. This should be ready in about 15 minutes. You can also set them by leaving in the fridge or any cool place (but allow extra time for setting).
Enjoy!

3/4 tbsp tamari or soya sauce
2 tsp lime juice
1/2 tsp chilli flakes
1 1/2 tbsp protein powder (optional)
2 lime wedges

Method
 

If you are using wooden skewers, soak them for about 20-30 mins in cold water so that they do not burn when you cook the satay


Make the marinade – Finely chop the lemon grass, root ginger, chillies and mix with crushed garlic in a bowl. Add the ground cumin, coriander, turmeric, agave syrup, lime juice, tamari/soya sauce and rapeseed or olive oil. Alternatively, you can blitz this all in a food processor to form a paste


Prepare the protein – Slice the tofu into thick slices about 1.5cm thick (or cubes if you are skewering them)


Make the satay – Put the peanut butter, coconut milk, chilli flakes, tamari or soya sauce, lime juice and protein powder of choice into a small saucepan and on a low heat melt the peanut butter and mix all the ingredients together to form a thick sauce. Pour into a bowl and decorate with 2 slices of fresh red chilli


Coat the tofu with the satay marinade for at least 30 mins in the fridge


Grill marinated tofu slices for about 4-5 mins each side. (Note: these are also great on the barbecue)


Season with a twist of ground black pepper. Serve with warm protein peanut satay sauce, wedges of lime (the sharpness contrasts beautifully with the creaminess and spicy marinade) and salad

A small bit of Pure soya butter for greasing
200g light muscavado sugar
200g grated pumpkin flesh (try squash either)
Finely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon
100g raisins
100g ground almonds
200g gluten free self-raising flour (normal flour will work too)
Pinch of salt
1tsp cinnamon
A generous grating of nutmeg
4 tbsp vinegar
4 tsp baking soda
The brine from one can of chickpeas

","
Method

Lightly grease a bread loaf tin (22 x 12cm or something like that) and line it with greaseproof paper/baking parchment. (I forgot to do this actually…)


Weigh out and prepare all your ingredients.


Add the lemon zest and juice, raisins and ground almonds to the pumpkin flesh in a large bowl.


Add the baking soda to the vinegar in a food mixing bowl.


Add the sugar to this and beat using an electric whisk for 2-3 minutes until pale and creamy.


Add this to the pumpkin mixture and lightly stir.


Sieve the flour and add to the mix along with the spices. Fold it all in together until well combined.


Using an electric whisk beat the chickpea brine until it holds soft peaks like what egg whites would do.


Stir a heaped tablespoon of this into the brack mixture to loosen it and then fold the rest in as lightly as possible.


Pour the mixture into a prepared load tin and even out the surface.


Bake it in the oven for around 1 hour at the temperature recommended.


Check if ready by inserting a skewer or knife into the centre. It should come out clean, but if it doesn’t, leave it in for longer and turn down the heat if it is starting to burn out the outside. Remove the loaf from the tin and leave in the oven at an even lower heat near the end to ensure thorough baking.


Then let it cool on a wire rack before slicing. Don’t be tempted to slice into it before it cools! It could fall apart!


Enjoy with some soya butter and a cup of tea.

Marinate prepared vegetables, using either the shashlik paste marinade or the basic marinade you have made yourself. Cover and set aside in fridge for half an hour.


In a large pan, add the vegetable oil then add the cardamom, cassia bark and cloves. Gently fry until aroma is released, then add chopped onion. Fry gently until onion is transparent and starting to turn golden. Remove the whole spices.


Lay the marinated vegetables (except the green beans and mushrooms) on a well oiled tray and bake in a hot oven (200C) for 15 minutes, turning occasionally to ensure nicely browned on all sides. The potatoes may need an additional 5-10 minutes depending on the size of the pieces. Check they are cooked through. Add the green beans and mushrooms to the tray and bake for another 10 minutes.


Add the ginger, chillies, paprika, coriander, garam masala and fenugreek powder to the large pan, and fry gently for 2 minutes. Then add the tomato puree, syrup and two cups of water. Bring to simmer and season to taste with salt. Simmer gently for 10-15 minutes, then add soy or almond cream and bring back to simmer.


I prefer to place the roasted vegetables in a bowl and pour over the masala, as this helps the vegetables keep their lovely marinade. But you can add the vegetables to the large pan also, stir gently and then serve immediately.
Serve with steamed rice and soft chapatis or parathas, garnish with fresh coriander, and some freshly sliced cucumber, red onion and a wedge of lemon on the side.

Ingredients

2 large sweet red bell peppers
2 large cloves of garlic
2 heaped tablespoons of tahini
1 tin (240g/8½oz drained or 1½ cups) tinned chickpeas
2 lemons
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
½ teaspoon sea salt

","
Method

De-seed, de-stalk and slice your peppers in half or quarters.
Next: roast the sweet pepper and garlic in a hot oven… To do this, keep the garlic in its skin and place on an oven tray along with the pepper and place in a pre-heated oven (gas mark 7/425°C/220°F should work fine). Roast garlic for up to 10 minutes and the pepper for about 15-20 minutes (or until the pepper is easy to pierce). No need to let the pepper char. Note: I find it easier to roast this ahead of time – get on with something else – and then set them out to cool for a little while before adding to the rest of the ingredients.
It’s best to wait until the garlic cools down a little before you pop it out of it’s skin. Gently chop off the top; then squeeze out the fleshy garlic and place in a jug ready to blend with everything else.
Rinse and drain chickpeas.
Juice lemon and discard the skin.
Add all ingredients to a jug and blend until you reached your desired consistency.
Chill in the fridge before serving.

This serves well with: salad in a sandwich on crackers as a veggie dip with baked potatoes or  coconut-sweet-potatoes It’s pretty versatile and should keep in the fridge for over a week.

a few spinach leaves, chopped
3 sprigs fresh coriander leaves, chopped
½ tomato, diced
¼ red onion, diced
½ green chilli (optional), finely sliced

Preparation
 
 

Method

Preparing the pancake batter: Soak the gram flour in water and soya yoghurt for approximately 2 hours.
Start warming a frying pan. When it’s slightly hot, grease the pan and sprinkle a pinch of salt. Then use a kitchen paper to wipe off the salt and oil from the pan.
Add the salt, powdered black pepper, ginger and ajwain seeds (if using) to the gram flour batter, and mix
thoroughly.
Into a teacup, add some gram flour batter, then add a quarter teaspoon of fruit salt or bicarbonate of
soda, stir vigorously, and immediately pour onto the heated pan in a circular motion.
Work very quickly to make the pancake circular, thin and approximately 6 inches in diameter.
While the top side of the pancake is wet, sprinkle the chopped coriander, spinach, tomatoes and
onions onto it.
Cook the pancake on medium heat, and don’t let it burn.
After a couple of minutes, check whether the pancake is easy to lift off the pan and if the
underside has cooked to golden brown. Add oil to the pancake edge if necessary to lift the
pancake.
If the pancake has turned to golden brown, turn the pancake over and let it cook on the other
side. If not, add a little oil to the pancake edge let it cook.
When cooked on both sides, remove the cooked pancake and serve.

Makes 4 pancakes.

819,https://veganuary.com/recipes/stuffed-peppers/,Stuffed Peppers,"
Ingredients

6 Bell Peppers
1 Small courgette
1 Small onion
3 Garlic cloves (crushed)
225g Brown rice
50g Currants
1 tsp Turmeric
1 tsp Cinnamon
½ tsp Sumac (optional)
1 litre Vegetable stock (I use Bouillon)
Olive oil
Salt and pepper

","
Preparation
Tips:

If your peppers don’t sit upright in the saucepan because there is space around them, then squeeze an onion or a potato in next to them to make them sit tight.


Add some olive oil to the pan of boiling water the peppers cook in. This will add a bit of flavour and soften them up nicely.


If you’d prefer to use white rice, just cut out the first stage. Add your rice into the onion mixture without pre-cooking it.


Method

Cook the brown rice for half of the time it suggests on the packet.


While the rice is cooking you can prep the peppers and filling – Wash the peppers and cut the tops off, making sure the green stalk is still attached so you can use the top of the pepper for a lid. De-seed and place all six in a saucepan so they stand upright. Set aside.


Dice the onion and gently fry in a medium sized frying pan with a little olive oil. Dice the courgette into small pieces and add to the pan along with the crushed garlic. Add the currants and spices.


By this time your rice should be ready. Drain it and add it to the pan. Stir to combine everything, turn up the heat and add your stock. Once it starts bubbling turn down to a low heat and let simmer until the liquid has evaporated and the rice has fully cooked. Add more liquid if needed. Once cooked, taste and season.


Spoon the rice into the peppers, filling them to the top, then place the top of the pepper back on. Repeat, so all six peppers are filled.


Carefully pour some boiling water into the saucepan, which the peppers are sitting in, making sure not to pour it over the peppers. The water should come up to about half the height of the peppers. Put a lid on, turn the hob onto a medium heat and let them simmer for 30 -45 minutes until the peppers have softened.

80ml coconut oil
80ml almond butter
50g Sukrin Gold
75g Sukrin Sesame Flour
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp sea salt

","
Preparation
Soak the nuts (and seeds if using) overnight with the salt.
(Whole nuts can cause digestive issues for some, which is largely due to their phytate content, an anti-nutrient that removes essential minerals from the body, and is found in grains, nuts and seeds. Soaking them and gently roasting them as we do in this recipe removes the phytates, thus making them more digestible and much safer to eat. Adding sesame or peanut flour adds extra yum plus protein, and they are free from sugar which makes them low carb too.) 

Method

Drain and rinse the soaked nuts well.
Place on a baking sheet and roast at GM4/350F/180C for 12-15 mins, checking and stirring regularly. Cool.
Roughly chop half the nuts. Process the rest until they begin to form a paste.
Melt together the almond butter and coconut oil, Sukrin Gold, vanilla and until the Gold is dissolved.
Stir in the nut paste and nuts, any additions and the Sesame Flour.
Pack into a lined dish, allow to sit in the fridge for an hour before slicing and serving.

6 cloves garlic
10 fresh sage leaves

2 tbsp Pumpkin Seed and Sun Dried Tomato Pesto (recipe link under preparation)
Optional: fresh basil leaves to garnish

","
Preparation
Please click for Marinara Sauce recipe
Please click for Pumpkin Seed and Sun Dried Tomato Pesto recipe

Method

On a medium to high heat, warm 1 tsp of the olive oil in a large, non-stick pan. Slice the mushrooms and the garlic and add these to the pan.
While the mushrooms and garlic are sautéing, chop the aubergine into cubes no larger than 1cm. Add the second tsp of oil and the aubergine cubes to the pan and give it a good stir.
Cook for about 10 minutes, until the aubergine cubes are lightly browned and soft. Roughly chop the sage leaves and add these too.
Bring a large pan of water to the boil and add the spaghetti.
You can now stir the marinara sauce into the pan with the aubergines and lower the heat, so it can bubble away while the spaghetti cooks.
Around 5 minutes before the pasta is ready spoon some of the pasta cooking water into the sauce until you have a consistency you’re happy with. The aubergines suck up a lot of the sauce, so this helps to loosen it all up again.
Once the spaghetti is ready drain it and add it to the sauce. Give it all a nice stir and spoon into bowls. To serve, dot the pesto around the bowl and sprinkle on some fresh basil.

1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon all-purpose gluten-free baking mix
3 tablespoons Dutch-process cocoa powder
3/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/8 teaspoon fine sea salt
1/4 teaspoon aluminum-free baking powder
3 to 4 grinds of black pepper, optional 
1 tablespoon ground chia seeds
2 tablespoons hot water
2 tablespoons non-dairy milk 
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, Grade B or dark amber 
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
5 tablespoons organic granulated sugar, plus 1/3 to 1/2 cup for shaping
2 1/2 tablespoons coconut oil, melted
1/3 cup gluten-free chocolate chunks

","
Preparation
Note: You don’t need skill but you do need extra time to make these cookies: Make sure you allow 30 minutes for whisking and allowing the dough to thicken. And remember when using melted coconut oil, all the other ingredients need to be at room temperature or the oil will harden into lumps during mixing.

Makes 1 dozen cookies


Method

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Place a wire mesh strainer over a medium bowl. Add the baking mix, cocoa, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder to the strainer and stir with a whisk to sift the ingredients into the bowl. (If any small bits remain in the strainer, add them to the mixture in the bowl.) Add the pepper if using; whisk to aerate the mixture, and set aside.
Make the chia gel: Put the ground chia seeds into a small bowl. Pour the hot water over the chia and set aside for 1 minute. Whisk for 30 seconds. (The paste will be thick.)
Whisk the nondairy milk into the chia paste until combined. Let sit for 5 minutes and whisk again. Whisk in the maple syrup and vanilla until combined. Let sit for 5 minutes and whisk again.
Add 5 tablespoons of the sugar and whisk vigorously for 1 minute to “cream” the sugar. Add the coconut oil and whisk until thoroughly incorporated. Add to the dry ingredients and mix with a silicone spatula until no traces of dry ingredients remain.
Mix the chocolate chunks into the dough—it will be shiny and thick but soft. Set aside for 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature to allow the dough to thicken, stirring every five minutes.
Shape the cookies: Put 1/3 cup of the remaining sugar into a shallow dish. Scoop the dough in a measuring tablespoon and push off into the sugar with a teaspoon. Roll the pieces in the sugar until thoroughly coated. Add more sugar as needed. Lift the cookies onto the parchment-lined baking sheet, placing them 2 inches apart. Press to flatten.
Place the baking sheet into the oven; immediately reduce the heat to 350°F, and bake for 11 minutes until the cookies are puffed and set. The cookies are soft when they come out of the oven but will firm as they cool.
Place the baking sheet on a wire rack. Wait 10 minutes until the cookies are cool, then run a spatula underneath to release.

Serving: Cold cookies offer up the crunch of hardened chocolate chunks, and warm cookies are gooey.
Keeping: Store the cookies in a covered tin or jar, layers separated by parchment, for up to two days. Freeze for up to one month.

830,https://veganuary.com/recipes/carrot-and-apple-cake-with-lemon-icing/,Carrot and Apple Cake with Lemon Icing,"
Ingredients

150g dairy-free margarine
100ml golden syrup or agave syrup
200g soft light brown sugar or coconut sugar
250g carrots
1 eating apple
100g apple puree
250g gluten-free self raising flour
3 tsp baking powder
½ tsp mixed spice
25g ground flaxseed
For the icing
150g icing sugar
2-3 tbsp lemon juice
The grated zest of 1 lemon and orange

","
Preparation

Serves 8-12
You will need an 8 inch/20 cm cake tin with removable base for this recipe

Despite its steps, it is incredibly easy to make and keeps really well (opt for an airtight tin or if pushed, a big freezer bag clipped over a plate) making it a real cut-and-come-again type bake, ideal for a friends and family do or a weekend when you know lots of people will be coming by.  

Method
Preheat the oven to 180c and lightly grease and line the cake tin.
Place the margarine, syrup and brown sugar (or coconut sugar) into a saucepan and heat gently over a low heat, stirring every now and then, until the sugar has completely dissolved. Take off the heat and pour into a large mixing bowl and leave to cool for 10 minutes.
Trim the ends from the carrots and core the apple, finely grate both – I don’t worry about peeling either the apple or carrots (though I do give them a good scrub first) but please, feel free to peel both if you want to.
Spoon the apple puree into the syrup mixture and stir together, sift over the flour, baking powder and mixed spice and fold together. Next, add the grated apple, carrot and the ground flaxseed and fold together until completely combined and fragrant. Pour the cake mixture into the prepared tin and then bake in the oven for 1 hour – 1 hour 10 minutes or until risen and golden and firm to the touch.
Leave the cake to cool in its tin for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Place the icing sugar into a mixing bowl and add the lemon juice, bit by bit, until the desired consistency. Spread over the cake and scatter over the lemon and orange zest.

831,https://veganuary.com/recipes/tarka-dal/,Tarka Dal,"
Ingredients

For the Dal:
3 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
2 tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp garam masala
2 tomatoes, finely chopped (or half a 400g tin of chopped tomatoes)
75g moong dal
75g red split lentils
600ml boiling water or vegetable stock
For the Tarka:
4 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 dried red chilli
¼ tsp chilli powder
¼ tsp asafoetida
4 curry leaves
½ tsp yellow mustard seeds
1 clove garlic, peeled and finely sliced

","
Preparation

To Make the Dal:

Place a medium saucepan over a medium heat and add the vegetable oil. Bring to temperature before adding the onion and frying for a few minutes. Do not allow the onion to brown.
Add the garlic and fry for a further few minutes before adding the turmeric, garam masala and tomatoes. Cook for a few minutes, stirring often, until the tomatoes start to lose their shape. Add the dal/lentils along with the boiling water or vegetable stock. Bring to a simmer before covering and turning the heat to low.
Allow the dal to cook for a total of 20-30 minutes, removing the lid to stir regularly. The dal is done when the lentils are completely soft but still hold their shape slightly.
Season with sea salt to taste.

To Make the Tarka:

Add the oil to a small saucepan or frying pan and place over a medium low heat. Once the oil is hot, add all the remaining ingredients except the garlic. Stirring constantly, fry the spices for around a minute – do not allow them to burn.
Once the spices are fried and the oil has taken on a slight red hue from the chilli, add the garlic and fry very briefly before removing from the heat and spooning over the cooked dal. Serve with some fresh coriander and some basmati rice or roti (optional).

Ingredients
For the almond ice cream base:

250ml coconut cream
1 cup of raw cashews, soaked overnight
1 cup water
2 tsp almond extract
1 can of chickpeas, liquid drained off (just shy of 1 cup)
1 cup icing sugar
1/2 tsp cream of tartar

For the roasted cherries:

250g cherries, pitted and cut into halves

For the cookie dough:

50g vegan butter, softened
25g brown sugar
75g plain flour
1/4 tsp vanilla
Pinch of salt

","
Preparation
Preheat the oven to 350f.

Method

Halve and pit the cherries. Spread on a baking tray and roast for 15-20 minutes until soft. Set aside to cool.


Next make the cookie dough, in a bowl beat together the butter and sugar. Sift in the flour and salt. Stir until fully combined. Set aside.


Make the cashew cream. Drain and rinse the soaked cashews then add them to the blender. Add 1 cup water and blend on high until completely smooth. Set aside.


Make the almond coconut whip. Beat the coconut cream in a stand mixer then add the almond extract. Pour in the cashew cream and beat again until fully incorporated. Pour into a container and set aside.


Make the vegan meringue. Clean the mixer bowl. Pour the chickpea brine into a saucepan and reduce on a medium heat for 5 minutes. You should end up with just shy of 3/4 of a cup of liquid. Add chickpea brine to the mixer bowl. Beat on high with the balloon whisk attachment for 5-8 minutes.


Once the soft peaks appear, add the cream of tartar. Beat for another 5 minutes, then slowly start adding the sugar bit by bit.


Whilst the meringue is whipping, using your hands break off fingernail sizes of the cookie dough and set aside.


Once the meringue has formed stiff peaks, immediately fold in the cashew coconut cream mixture. It will deflate by almost half. Stir in the roasted cherries and cookie dough.


Pour the ice cream mixture into a container and place in the freezer for at least 8 hours, preferably overnight. Remove from the freezer 5-10 minutes before serving.

• Non-dairy milk
Mushroom Duxelle
• 300g chestnut mushrooms
• 1 small red onion
• 100g chestnuts (boiled or roasted and peeled)
• 1 sprig of thyme
","
Method
1. Roughly chop the OmniPork strips and add to the OmniPork mince. Season with salt and black pepper. Add the corn starch and mix well. Put in fridge to chill for 30 mins.
2. Use clingfilm to form the mince mixture into a log shape approximately 20cm in length. Leave in fridge to chill whilst preparing the mushroom duxelles.
3. For the mushroom duxelles, dice the mushrooms and onions finely (or use a food processor). Cook the diced mushrooms and onions over a medium heat, season with black pepper, salt and thyme leaves, until all the water is cooked off. Roughly chop the chestnuts and add to the mixture. Set aside and let it cool down completely.
4. Heat a pan with a good lug of oil and add a small bunch of thyme. Season the Omni log generously with black pepper and salt and sear all sides over high heat. Whilst the Omni log is still hot, use a pastry brush and cover it with mustard.
5. Unroll the puff pastry and spread the mushroom duxelles so that they will cover the entire Omni log once rolled over.
6. Place the Omni log on top of the mushroom duxelles and use a non-dairy milk to wash the edges of the puff pastry. Carefully roll over the puff pastry, covering the entire Omni log. Cut off any excess pastry and pinch to seal the ends.
7. Optional (skip to step 8)– Wash the pastry with non-diary milk and place a lattice pastry on top using the second pack of puff pastry roll. Wash the lattice work with non-dairy milk, season with salt and bake for 30mins in a preheated oven at 200c.

50g green beans
1g brown mustard seeds
1g cumin seeds
1g cloves
1g chilli powder
1g turmeric
1.5g ground coriander
1.5g ground cumin
20g crushed ginger
20g crushed garlic
1 small can coconut milk
5g palm sugar
Milma Batter Mix ½ bag
","
Method
1. Prepare the jackfruit – Drain the can of jackfruit and trim the firm pointy ends off each piece and discard. Use a fork to make sure the jackfruit is well shredded.
2. Prepare the veg – Peel and thinly slice the onion, roughly dice the tomato and thinly slice the green chilli. Roughly chop the coriander and chop the green beans into thirds. Set the prepared veg aside until required.
3. Fry the onions – Heat 3 tbsp of oil in a saucepan and add the brown mustard seeds, cumin seeds and cloves. Sizzle the spices for 1 minute before adding in the sliced onions and a pinch of salt. Fry until golden brown for 5 minutes. Fill and boil your kettle.
4. Add the aromatics and jackfruit – Next add the crushed ginger, garlic and green chilli and fry for 1 minute. Add chilli powder, turmeric, ground cumin and ground coriander, and fry for 1 more minute. Then add in the jackfruit pieces and 100ml of boiling water and simmer for 2 minutes.
5. Add the coconut milk and simmer – Pour in the coconut milk and add the palm sugar, then continue to simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Add the rest of the veg – Add the green beans and tomato and simmer gently for 10 minutes to allow the veg to soften and the sauce to thicken. After 10 minutes, cover the pan with a lid and remove from the heat.
7. Time to make the hoppers – Heat 1 tbsp of oil in your pan on a medium heat, then carefully swirl the oil around the pan to grease the sides. Pour in a ladle of the batter and swirl again, partially covering the sides of the pan with batter until you’ve achieved a bowl-shaped pancake about 8-10cm tall (a wider saucepan will make for a shorter hopper)
8. Cook the hopper – Cook the hopper uncovered for 1 minute then cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 minutes more until the edges are starting to crisp and the base is cooked through. Loosen the sides of the hooper gently to remove it from the pan. Repeat the process until you have 4 hoppers. Keep the hoppers in a warm place.
9. Finishing touches – Add the chopped coriander to the curry and stir through. Serve the hoppers on plates and fill with the jackfruit curry.

Ingredients

For the maple meringues:
Chickpea brine drained from 1 can of chickpeas – approximately 1 cup of liquid
3/4 Grade B Maple Syrup
1 tsp vanilla bean paste
1/4 tsp cream of tartar
For the chocolate dipping:
50g dark chocolate (70%)
1 tsp coconut oil

","
Preparation
Preheat the oven to 200f.
Line two baking trays with parchment paper or silpat mats.
I had some extra meringue mixture leftover so I mixed it up with some raw cacao powder and drizzled through some of the chocolate dip and froze it! Chocolate ice cream!

Method

First reduce the chickpea brine. Pour it into a saucepan and boil for 2-3 minutes until reduced 2/3 of a cup. Set aside to cool for at least ten minutes.


Once the brine is cool, add it to the stand mixer and beat on high until foamy. Once soft peaks form, add the cream of tartar. Beat for 3 minutes.


Start adding the maple syrup in 1/4 cup increments, pouring slowly and beating until fully incorporated. The meringue will form stiff peaks.


Beat in the vanilla bean paste. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag and pipe the meringue into medium sized rounds.


Repeat until there is no more space on the trays. Bake the meringues in the oven for 2 hours.


Remove the trays from the oven and allow the meringues to cool for 20 minutes.


Whilst the meringues are cooling, prepare the chocolate dip. In a heat proof bowl over a pan of boiling water, melt the chocolate and coconut oil, stirring to incorporate.


Once the meringues are cooled, carefully peel them off the paper and dip half of each into the chocolate mixture.


Store in an airtight container in the fridge.

Ingredients

4 Potatoes of equal size*
Pure soya butter
Gluten-free plain flour
Salt and pepper
*To make this for more people just use equal quantities of grated to mashed potato.

","
Method

Wash and peel the potatoes.


Put half your potatoes on to boil.


Grate the other half of your potatoes into a bowl.


Put the grated potatoes into a tea-towel and squeeze out all the liquid until you have the dried potato gratings.


When the other potatoes are boiled mash them well using a potato masher.


Combine the grated potatoes and mashed potatoes in a bowl and add salt and pepper.


Add a tablespoon of flour into the potato mixture a mix in with your hands until you have a type of potatoey dough.


Sprinkle some flour over a dry counter and knead your dough for a few minutes.


Using a floured rolling pin roll out the dough and cut into squares or “farls”. The recipe I followed said to roll it out thinly but you can roll it out to whatever thickness you want.


Melt some vegan butter in a hot frying pan and add your boxty cakes to the pan. Brown them on each side and then lower the heat and let them cook through slowly. This should take around 10-15 minutes depending on how thick your boxty cakes are.


Enjoy your boxty for breakfast with vegan sausages and ketchup, or for your dinner with thyme fried mushrooms, fried cabbage, beans and vegan sausages.

2-3 tbsp ice water
2 tbsp agave / maple syrup
1 tbsp vanilla extract

","
Preparation
Serves 8.
The pie crust is suitable for freezing.
 

Method
Sweet Potato Filling:

Bake unpeeled sweet potatoes in the oven at 450F for 45-50 minutes, or until cooked all the way through.
Remove potatoes from oven and let cool enough to peel them.
Place an oven rack on 2nd to last shelf, then reheat thee oven to 350F.
Peel the potatoes then puree in a food processor.
Add egg replacer, agave, maple syrup, and vanilla to processor and mix well.
Heat cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger in a small skillet on medium-low heat for 30 seconds. Then add the margarine to the pan and melt.
Add the mixture to the potatoes and mix well.
Pour mixture into the piecrust then cover the rim of the piecrust with foil and place on bottom rack of the over.
Bake for 45-50 minutes where pie filling should be firm to touch.
Remove the foil during the last 10 minutes of baking to brown the crust.

Pie Crust:

Cut margarine into 1/2 inch pieces and place in the freezer for 15-30 minutes. In a small bowl mix egg replacer and water and sit to the side.
Combine the flour and salt in a bowl of a food processor or mixer. Pulse 5-6 times of until the mixture resembles coarse meal with some pea size pieces of margarine.
Mix together the egg replacer, water, agave and vanilla. With processor running, add the mixture until you get a slightly moist and sticky dough. Do not over mix. For gluten free dough its best to be too moist than dry.
Remove the dough from the machine and form into 2 evenly sized disks. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and let sit 15 minutes.
To roll the dough, lay a piece of waxed or parchment paper on a work surface and sprinkle paper, sprinkle some more flour and lay on another piece of parchment paper. Roll the dough into a circle approximately 12 inches wide.
Remove top sheet of parchment paper and invert dough into pie/tart pan. Remove the top sheet of parchment paper and push the dough very gently down so it lines the bottom and sides of the pie plate. If the dough splits or breaks just push it back together. Trim the edge of the piecrust to about 1/2 – 3/4 inch over hand. Tuck the overhand under and pinch the dough into a decorative finish.
The other crust can either be used as a topping or can be refrigerated for up to 2 -3 days or frozen. Let sit out to warm slightly if in the fridge before use.

Add the lentils, water, stock, salt, pepper and sage to the pan. Simmer for 20-30 minutes until the lentils are very soft. Add splashes of water if the pan dries out.
In a food processor or the chopper attachment of a hand blender grind the oats, walnuts and seeds. Grind the pink peppercorns in a pestle and mortar.
Layer the gateau using a small cake tin or chef’s rings. Start with a thin layer of squash, then add a layer of lentils, then squash, the lentils, then squash. Bake for 10-20 minutes until completely heated through.
Add the nut/seed sprinkle and place the gateau on servings plates. Dress with a scattering of crushed pink peppercorns.

Preparation
Serves eight

Method

Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F and spray an 8 inch tart pan with non stick spray.

Meanwhile, place all of the caramel ingredients into a pan over a low-medium heat and gently heat, avoiding stirring, just until all of the sugar has dissolved (it will caramelise in the oven, do not caramelise on the stove as it will become bitter when baking).
Spread the cookie dough into the pan, making a few shallow indentations for pools of caramel to sit.
Pour a thin layer of caramel over the cookie, it’s good to keep some behind to heat further on the stove to make a sauce for drizzling.
Bake until puffed and golden, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let the dangerously hot caramel cool a little before slicing, the inside should be warm and gooey.

1 tsp vanilla extract
1.5 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp baking powder
50g dark chocolate, chopped into small pieces
2.5 tbsp peanut butter
Himalayan pink salt, for sprinkling

","
Preparation
For this recipe I have used dark vegan chocolate instead of chocolate chips. Cacao nibs are also great, you just don’t get that satisfying melt.
Makes 15 small cookies.

Method
1. Heat the oven to 180°C / 350°F / Gas Mark 4.
2. Put the coconut oil into a ramekin and melt it in the oven.
4. Put all of the ingredients except the salt in a bowl and mix by hand until completely combined. Leave it in the fridge for ten minutes.
5. Take a teaspoon of the mixture, roll it into a ball and place it on a parchment paper-lined tray. Repeat until all of the cookie mixture is used up.
6. Using your thumb, flatten each cookie ball gently and sprinkle a couple of flakes of the pink salt into each thumb print.
7. Cook for no more than 12 minutes, you don’t want burnt chocolate!
I like to wait for these to cool down a little before tucking in, and I store them in the fridge. For an extra treat (although not a guilty one) fill the thumb prints with some toffee cashew cream. Yum!

1. Start by making the peanut sauce. Measure all the ingredients into a small saucepan, place over a low heat and heat, stirring continuously, until the mixture just begins to bubble. Remove from the heat and set aside.
2. Place the noodles in a heatproof bowl, pour over boiling water to cover and leave to soak for 10 minutes until rehydrated. Drain well and return to the dried-out bowl. Drizzle over the sesame oil and toss the noodles to evenly coat in the oil.
3. Fill a separate bowl with hot water. Take a rice paper wrapper and dip in the hot water for about 5 seconds until soft and pliable – they really don’t need long.
4. Lay the wrapper on a board and, working quickly, arrange some of the herb leaves down the centre of the wrapper. Then take a little of each of the thinly cut vegetables to create a neat pile in the centre of the wrapper. Finally, place a small bundle of rehydrated noodles on the very top of the veg. Fold in the edges of the wrapper over the veggies and then roll up.
5. Repeat with the remaining wrappers, herbs, veg and noodles.
6. Cut each roll in half to expose the pretty rainbow colours of the vegetables and serve with the warm peanut sauce.

Instructions


Beans: In a small mixing bowl, add refried beans and mash well, add cumin, chipotle powder and 1/4 cup of water, mix well to combine.

3 tablespoons, give or take, sweet almond oil, jojoba or extra virgin olive oil

optional ingredients:

1 tsp vanilla extract w/o alcohol
few drops of vitamin E oil
1/2 small lemon, juice of
or a few drops of your favorite essential oils such as spearmint, lavender, grapefruit, etc (see notes)


","

Instructions


Mix: Place sugar in a small/medium size container and add the oil 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing in between. You want the consistency to be sandy, not soupy. If the mix is too soupy, the sugars will dissolve in a day or two and not slough the skin as well, but you will still get added moisture from the oil.
To Use: At the end of showering, pat the skin dry and gently rub the sugar scrub in a circular motion over your body, rinse well. I find it works best after soaking in the tub for at least 20 minutes. Soaking first will help soften the skin, allowing the scrub work to at its best, leaving your skin soft and supple!
It can be used 2 – 4 times a week (depending on the sugar type).
Store: Sugar scrub should be sealed when not in use and stored on a shower caddy or kept in a cabinet. It is best used within 1 month.

Instructions


Marinade: In a large bowl, mix together the marinade, add the tempeh and let set for at least 15 minutes, up to 4 hours in the refrigerator, turning every so often. Reserve marinade for later.
Cook Tempeh: Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat. Spoon in the tempeh, reserving most of the glaze in the bowl (set aside for later). Saute for 6 – 8 minutes, turning on each side until browned.
Add veggies: Add the cabbage and carrots to the tempeh, cook for about 3 minutes, add scallions, a spoonful of marinade and cook another 2 minutes or until desired firmness (I like mine al dente). Add a tad more marinade as needed, reserve the rest to spoon over serving bowls.
Serve: In individual bowls, add 1/3 of the stir fry with a 1/2 or so of grain of choice – White or brown rice, quinoa or soba noodles would all be great. This Cilantro Lime Rice would be especially delicious! Top with any remaining sauce, sesame seeds and few extra scallions and cilantro.
Serves 3
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 – 5 days, in a covered container.

Instructions


Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Potatoes: If leaving the skins on, scrub the potatoes, and remove any unsightly blemishes. Alternately, peel the potatoes. Slice the potatoes into 1/8 inch slices using a mandolin, or manually with a knife. If manually slicing, do try to cut evenly as possible so potatoes will cook uniformly.
Cream Sauce: Add the cashews, milk and/or veg broth, nutritional yeast, garlic, onion powder, salt, pepper and lemon juice/vinegar to a high speed blender and blend until creamy, about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Taste for flavor, adding more of anything you like. Makes about 3 cups.
Assemble: In a 9 x 13 baking dish, pour a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the dish, layer 1/2 of the potatoes, top with 1/2 cream sauce, and repeat. Top with a sprinkle of thyme, and any additional vegan cheese. Alternatively, after adding sauce to the bottom of the dish, make three rows of potatoes, layering them at an angle, pour sauce evenly overtop.
Bake: Place in oven, cover with lid, foil or silpat (see notes), and bake for 40 minutes. Remove cover and bake another 30 minutes, potatoes should be fork tender. Once done, sprinkle with a little more thyme, and let cool 5 – 10 minutes before serving.
Serve topped with optional chopped chives, parsley, or more fresh thyme and/or freshly ground pepper.
Store leftovers in an air container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat in oven at 350, covered with foil, for 20 – 30 minutes, until warmed through.

Saute: In a skillet or pan, heat oil or water over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion and garlic, add saute for 5 minutes, adding the herbs during the last minute. Let cool for a few minutes.
Food processor: If using the nuts/seeds, place in food processor first and pulse until coarsely ground, and continue. Also, if using old fashioned oats place them in the with the nuts to chop them up a bit. Add the beans, sauteed veggies, oats. Pulse until just combined (don’t overmix or it’ll turn into a paste). Taste for seasoning adding anything extra you may like. I added in some fresh chopped basil I had on hand.

1 cup (100g) fresh blueberries (frozen is ok too)

optional add ins

1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Instructions


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9 x 5 loaf pan lightly with oil.
Combine: In a medium sized mixing bowl, add the flour, oats, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, optional cinnamon and pinch of salt, stir to combine.
Mash the bananas by hand in a small bowl, using the back of a fork or slotted spoon.
Mix: To the dry ingredients, add the mashed bananas, oil, plant milk and optional vanilla, mix to combine, just until the flour is incorporated. Best practice for mixing quick bread batter: Don’t overmix, as overmixing the ingredients will cause the gluten proteins to create an elastic batter that will not rise well.
Gently fold in the blueberries.
Pour the batter into a lightly greased 9 x 5 loaf pan. Optionally, add a few blueberries strategically to the top and sprinkle a small handful of oats over top. I added quick oats, but old fashioned oat would look nice too. You can also chop old fashioned oats into smaller pieces.
Bake: Place loaf pan in oven and bake for 50 – 55 minutes, rotating the pan once halfway through. Top will turn golden and toothpick placed in the center will come out clean.
Once done, let cool for 15 minutes in the pan. You should be able to tilt the pan and the loaf will come out clean, place on rack to cool completely.


Store covered on the counter for up to 3 days or in the refrigerator up to 1 week. Keep in the freezer for up to 3 months – place completely cooled loaves in freezer containers or bags. Thaw the wrapped loaves overnight in the refrigerator.

Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




2 pounds organic yukon gold potatoes
2 small leeks, sliced and any dirt removed
2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 cup raw slivered almonds 
4 – 6 large garlic cloves, minced
6 cups water or vegetable broth, + more as needed
1/2 cup rice (basmati or jasmine rice)
1 pinch saffron, partially crushed
mineral salt and fresh cracked pepper, to taste
2 teaspoons sherry vinegar or red/white wine vinegar
2 tablespoons flat leaf parsley, minced


","

Instructions


Potatoes: Cut potatoes into irregular chunks by inserting the tip of a small, sharp knife into a potato and twisting until a 1 1/2 chunk comes out. Repeat until the entire potato is cut up, than continue with the remaining potatoes, set aside. You can also just roughly chop the potatoes into 1 1/2 inch chunks. Peeling is optional.
Fried Almonds + Garlic: Heat oil in a heavy pot over medium heat, add almonds and garlic, cooking, stirring frequently until golden, 3 – 4 minutes. Transfer the almonds and garlic to a bowl to cool slightly. In a food processor, place the garlic and almonds, pulse until desired texture. I left mine fairly course. You can also simply mince them with a knife. Add all but 2 tablespoons to the soup. Season soup with salt and pepper to taste.
Saute: Add leeks and a 2 tablespoons of water to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. 
Simmer: Add potatoes, vegetable broth and rice, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer 40 to 45 minutes.
Saffron: Remove a few tablespoons of soup from the pot and place in a small bowl, add saffron and let steep for 2 minutes, add to the soup. Add a little more water or broth if the soup seems to thick and continue to cook.
Add remaining ingredients: Add the vinegar to the reserved ground almond mixture and stir in the soup. Add the parsley and cook for a minute. Taste for seasonings, adding a little more salt and vinegar if necessary. 
Serve with dense whole grain or artisan bread or naan bread.
Store: Leftover can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 – 5 days. Keep longer in the freezer, up to 2 – 3 months.
NOTES:
If using almonds with the skin, just know that the skins will fall off in the soup. For me this is not an issue (I like the added fiber) but if you’re serving for company you may consider using blanched almonds.
How to make without rice: Reduce the liquids to 4 cups, adding more as needed. When soup is done, if you’d like it a little creamier, mash a few of the potato pieces with the back of a spoon.
Slow Cooker: Add the leeks, potatoes, rice and liquids to the bowl of your slow cooker. Cook on LOW for 4 – 5 hours or HIGH for 3 – 4 hours. Fry the almonds and garlic according to directions and continue with the recipe add the mixture and saffron at the end of cooking.

2/3 cup chickpea flour (aka garbanzo bean or besan)
2/3 cup water
1/2 heaping teaspoon baking soda (can be optional)
pinch of turmeric (will give it a yellow color), optional
1/2 teaspoon cumin, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
mineral salt, to taste
juice of 1/2 small lemon or 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

Add-ins:

2/3 cup greens (kale or spinach), julienned and loosely packed
small handful mushrooms, thinly sliced
1/2 shallot, finely diced
7 grape tomatoes, halved or quartered depending on the size


","

Instructions


Preheat griddle on medium.
Mix: In a medium size bowl, combine flour, water, baking soda, optional turmeric, cumin, garlic powder and salt to taste. Mix well ensuring all the flour lumps are gone. Add in lemon, stir and you will notice the batter rise and foam a bit. Add in veggies and combine thoroughly. (Note: I don’t really measure the vegetables, so this is an approximation)
Cook: Pour 1/2 of the mixture onto the preheated griddle or skillet. You can use your spatula to move the veggies around and flatten as needed if they are piled up in areas. Also you can help make your pancake round by gently pushing in the edges where needed. There may be times when it appears that you have more veggies than batter, don’t panic….in a few minutes the batter will puff up from the baking soda and fill in making it look fluffy and full. Let cook for 5 minutes. Flip and cook another 5 – 7 minutes, making sure the batter cooks throughout.
Serve with your choice of condiments. A thinned hummus would also be great! Pairs well with fresh fruit on the side.
Makes 2 pancakes
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, in a covered container. Reheat in the toaster oven or microwave.

1 – 2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large head cauliflower
blackened, creole or cajun seasoning of choice (recipe for homemade below)
1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes
chopped fresh parsley, to serve
lemon wedges, to garnish
grain of choice – quinoa, brown rice or farro
himalayan salt, to taste
fresh ground pepper, to taste


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Prep the Cauliflower: Place the cauliflower stem side down, and using a sharp knife cut into the top center and slice the cauliflower in half. You want to create as many cauliflower steaks as you can from the center cut out that will be at least 3/4 inch thick. The remaining sides and pieces can be cut into cauliflower nuggets and roasted alongside the steaks, or on a separate baking sheet. I feel it’s best to use two baking sheets to prepare this meal. Using two will give you plenty of room for the steak slices to be turned over without too much crowding.
Roasting: Grease your baking sheet/s and carefully place your cauliflower steaks along with the broken florets, or place the florets on a separate baking sheet. Using an small brush, gently brush the ‘steaks’ and florets with oil. Sprinkle as much seasoning as you wish to coat on ‘steaks’ and florets. Add your tomatoes to the baking sheet, you can coat these with oil too and add a sprinkle of sea salt.
Place your baking sheet into the oven, if using two, place sheets on separate racks or side by side, depending on the size. Bake for 15 minutes, gently flip ‘steaks’ and stir florets, season again and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
Serve immediately with roasted tomatoes, grain of choice, sprinkle of chopped parsley and lemon wedges.

2 medium potatoes, diced (with or without the skin)
1 small onion, diced
1 bell pepper, diced
1 zucchini, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
handful grape tomatoes, halved or quartered
pinch of red pepper flakes, optional

for the blender/food processor

1 package (16 oz) organic silken tofu (soft or firm), drained (no pressing needed)
1/4 cup unsweetened non-dairy milk
2 heaping teaspoons cornstarch, arrowroot or tapioca flour
2 – 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon mustard (any kind) or 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder
1 1/2 teaspoons dried tarragon, thyme or basil (or a combo)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1/8 teaspoon pepper (black or white)


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Saute: Heat oil in a pan over medium heat, saute potatoes for 5 minutes, add onion and cook an additional 5 minutes. Add bell pepper, zucchini and garlic, cook until softened. Add tomatoes and optional red pepper flakes, cook another minute or two. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Tofu egg: In a food processor/blender, combine the remaining ingredients and process until smooth. Taste for seasoning.
Assemble: Add the tofu mixture to the pan the vegetables cooked in and mix well. Spoon mixture into a lightly greased 9 inch round pie/quiche dish or springform pan. Level the top flat with the back of a spatula or spoon and make sure all edges are filled. 
Bake: Place on the middle rack and bake for 35 – 45 minutes, frittata should be firm to the touch. If top starts to brown too much, cover with foil or small silpat. Remove and let cool for at least 10 minutes. If using a pie/quiche dish, loosen the edges of the frittata, place a plate over top and carefully flip so frittata falls onto the plate and serve (this step is optional).
This frittata is wonderful with sliced avocado and a little sriracha for heat.
Serves 4 – 6

1 can (14 oz) organic black beans, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup oats (rolled or quick)
1/4 cup flax meal or flour of choice (see notes)
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon cayenne or chipotle powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon pink salt
1/4 cup chunky salsa or pico de gallo, give or take
1 tablespoon olive oil, for pan-frying
cornmeal, for dusting (I used coarse grind) (optional)


","

Instructions


Mash black beans: In a medium-size bowl, mash black beans with a strong fork or use a potato masher, leaving some chunks for texture if you like. 
Make patty mixture: Add oats, flour, spices, salt, and salsa, mix again, feel free to use your hands if you like to. If the mixture is too wet, add more flax meal/flour to the mix, but really it should be ok. Taste for flavor.
Shape patties: Divide the mixture and shape your patties into whatever size you like. I like to make 2 jumbo-sized burger patties, but you can make 3 – 4 smaller ones. Give a light dusting of cornmeal if you have it. It will give a nice crunch, flavor and cook up crispy.
Cook on the stovetop, oven, or grill:

Stovetop: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet on medium. Cook for about 5 minutes on each side. It’s ok if the cornmeal gets a little crispy. Trust me, it’s delicious!
Oven (oil-free): Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicone mat. Place patties on a baking sheet, place in the oven on the center rack, and bake for 10 – 15 minutes, flip and repeat.

Serve with your choice of accompaniments such as red onion slices, leafy greens, salsa, or Vegan Mayo. Add some mashed avocado as a spread or sliced avocado if you prefer. Or serve on a bed of leafy greens. 
Makes 2 jumbo-sized patties or 3 – 4 smaller ones.

1/2 heaping teaspoon saffron or turmeric
2 tablespoons olive oil or 1/4 cup water/veggie broth
1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced
2 bell peppers (red, orange or yellow), cored and thinly sliced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 cups green beans or asparagus, cut into 2-inch pieces
1 lb. (16 oz) tomatoes, seeded and diced or 1 can (14 oz.) diced tomatoes + juice
1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional
2 – 3 bay leaves
1 1/2 cups short grain rice (Valencia or arborio)
3 1/2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
1/2 – 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 can/jar (14 oz) artichoke hearts in water, drained and quartered
1 cup green peas (fresh or frozen, thawed)
chopped parsley leaves, to garnish
lemon wedges, to serve


","

Instructions


Steep saffron: In a small bowl, add the saffron threads to 3 tablespoons warm water, let set 10 minutes to steep. If using turmeric, skip this step and add turmeric with the other spices.
Saute: Heat olive oil/broth over medium heat in a large wide flat-bottomed pan or paella pan (a dutch oven or large pot would also suffice). Add onions and bell peppers, cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, green beans, tomatoes, smoked paprika, red pepper flakes and bay leaves, cook another 3 minutes stirring frequently. For softer veggies, cook another 7 minutes or so, totaling 10 minutes after adding the latter ingredients.
Add rice + broth: Add in the rice, broth, saffron mixture/turmeric and salt. Gently move the vegetables around so the rice falls to the bottom of the pan as much as possible. 
Boil + simmer: Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium or medium-low and cook at a continuous gentle boil, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Do not stir the rice. If using a large paella pan (15 inches or so) you’ll want to rotate the pan over the burner every so often to help cook the rice evenly. Stay in the kitchen and clean up so you’re right there to adjust the pan when needed. If liquids seem to boil off too quickly, add a little extra warm water/broth.
Add peas and artichokes: After 15 minutes of cooking, scatter the peas and artichoke hearts on top, cook for 5 minutes more. 
Cover to steam: Turn off heat and cover for 10 minutes with a kitchen towel or other cover of choice. This will allow the rice to absorb any remaining liquid as well as steam the peas and warm the artichoke hearts and any other optional ingredients added as noted below. Once done, lightly fluff the rice and serve. Discard bay leaves before eating. Season with salt, pepper or more paprika to taste.
Serve: Garnish with chopped parsley. Pairs perfectly with a side of leafy greens and a big squeeze of lemon over top. Enjoy straight from the pan or serve in individual bowls.

7 oz. organic tofu, use firm, extra-firm or super-firm
1 1/2 – 2 teaspoons sesame oil (or other neutral oil)
dash of garlic powder
2 large zucchini, spiralized or julienned
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
2 – 3 green onions, sliced into 1 inch pieces
1 cup shredded carrots or 2 carrots julienned
large handful snow peas
1/8 red cabbage, thinly shredded
1/4 – 1/3 cup chopped cilantro
handful bean sprouts, optional

Spicy Peanut Dressing

3 rounded tablespoons almond butter or natural peanut butter
1 clove garlic, minced or good pinch of garlic powder
2 tablespoons tamari, coconut aminos or soy sauce
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger or 1 teaspoon freshly grated
2 limes, juice of
1/4 – 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes or 1/2 – 1 teaspoon sambal oelek
water as needed to thin, about 2 – 3 tablespoons


","

Instructions


Press & cook tofu: If using firm or extra-firm tofu, you’ll most likely want to press it a bit to remove excess water (if using super-firm tofu you can skip this step). Place tofu between a clean, double folded kitchen towel. Place a heavy book or pot over top to use as a press. Let set for at least 10 minutes, and up to 30 minutes. Once done, slice tofu into 1 inch pieces, about 1/4 inch thick. Heat a pan over medium heat, with 2 teaspoons of oil, twirl the pan to coat with oil. Place tofu in pan and cook about 4 – 5 minutes, flip, sprinkle with a little garlic powder and cook another 4 – 5 minutes. The time given here is for super-firm tofu. If using firm or extra-firm, you’ll most likely need to cook about 4 minutes longer on each side. Tofu will be ready when golden on both sides. Set aside.
Mix dressing: In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the dressing and mix well. Add water 1 tablespoon at a time to thin as needed. If dressing becomes to thin, add a little nut butter. Taste for flavor and set aside. Keep in mind that the flavors will mellow into each other as it sits. If using coconut amino’s, you may want to add a pinch of mineral salt. Taste again for flavor before mixing with vegetables.
Prep and cook vegetables: Once vegetables are prepped, heat wok or pan over medium-high heat. Add the bell peppers, carrots, green onions, cabbage and snow peas, cook stirring constantly for 2 minutes. We just want them to become ever so slightly softened (not too much). Add zucchini noodles and cook for 2 more minutes, stirring constantly to ensure everything cooks evenly. Remove from heat. Toss in tofu and cilantro, give a good stir. Add peanut dressing over top and mix well to coat.
Serve: Place portions in bowl and serve with lime wedges, chopped peanuts and optional bean sprouts. Easy, peasy – delicious!
Serves 2 generously or 3 smaller portions
NOTES:
If you’re a vinegar lover, feel free to add 1 tablespoon apple cider or rice wine vinegar to the dressing ingredients.
If allergic to peanuts, use sesame seeds instead (or cashews).

Loaf

2 1/2 cups vegetable broth 
3 tablespoons flaxseed meal (ground flaxseeds)
1/3 cup water
2 tablespoons olive oil OR steam saute using 1/4 cup water
3 garlic cloves, minced

1/2 – 1 teaspoon cumin, optional
1/4 – 1/2 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper, optional
cracked pepper & sea salt, to taste

Glaze

3 tablespoons organic ketchup
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar or balsamic (see notes)
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup


","

Instructions


Prepare lentils: Rinse the lentils, remove odd pieces. In large pot add 2 1/2 cups water/broth with lentils. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer for about 35 – 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. It’s ok if they get mushy, we are going to roughly puree 3/4 of the mixture when cooled. Once done, remove lid and set aside to cool (there should only be a little bit of water so do not drain), lentils will thicken a bit upon standing, about 15 minutes is good.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Make flax egg: In small bowl combine flaxseed meal and 1/3 cup water, set aside for at least 10 minutes, preferably in the refrigerator. This will act as a binder and will thicken nicely upon sitting.
Saute vegetables & spices: In saute pan heat oil or water over medium heat. Saute garlic, onion, bell pepper, carrots and celery for about 5 minutes. Add spices mixing well to incorporate. Set aside to cool.
Mash the lentils: Using an immersion blender, food processor, back of a fork or potato masher, blend 3/4 of the lentil mixture. For me this was an important part, I tried it other ways and this worked to help as a binder. If using an immersion blender, tilt the pot slightly to the side for easier blending.
Assemble lentil loaf: Combine sauteed vegetables with the lentils, oats, oat flour and flax-egg, mix well. Taste, adding salt and pepper as needed, or any other herb or spice you might like. Place mixture into a loaf pan lined with parchment paper, leaving it overlapping for easy removal later. Press down firmly filling in along the edges too.
Glaze: Prepare your glaze by combining all ingredients in a small bowl, mix until incorporated. I recommend making each tablespoon heaping so you have plenty of this great sauce on top (if using tomato paste and mixture is too thick, add a teaspoon of water, or a little extra vinegar & syrup). Spread evenly over top the loaf.
Bake: Place in center of the oven, and bake in oven for about 45 – 50 minutes. Let cool a bit before slicing.
Serves 8
Serving suggestions: Serve with cooked asparagus, green beans, brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, roasted red potatoes, scalloped potatoes, savory sauteed kale, baked beans, macaroni salad and/or simple salad, etc.

1 (8 oz.) package tempeh (I used this three grain tempeh), crumbled
1 large onion, chopped
3 large cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil or 1/4 cup water, for sauteing
1 can (15 oz.) red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
1 can (15 oz.) pinto beans, drained and rinsed

1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder, optional

1 bottle (8oz.) dark beer (Negra Modelo 1 bottle = 1 1/2 cups) plus 1/2 cup additional water or 2 cups water

Optional garnish:

sliced scallions
Vegan Cashew Sour Cream


","

Instructions


Stovetop: In a large dutch oven or stock pot, heat your oil/water over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, spices and tempeh and cook for 5 minutes stirring frequently. Add beans, tomatoes, green chili and dark beer/water, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, partially cover and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Chili will thicken upon cooling.
Slow Cooker: Add the ingredients to the bowl of your slow cooker, ending with the liquids. Cook on LOW for 6 – 8 hours or HIGH  for 3 – 4 hours. Chili will thicken as it cools.
Serve with optional garnish. Also, pairs perfectly with Jalapeno Cornbread Muffins or Sweet Chia Cornbread!
Serves 4 – 6
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for 5 – 6, kept in airtight container. To store longer, store in the freezer with freezer safe containers for 2 – 3 months.
NOTES:
Mix the beans up however you like using all of one type or your favorite combination. If you would rather use only 2 cans of beans, that’s great too! I like adding more ingredients as it makes the chili go further. If using your own cooked beans you’ll need about 4 1/2 cups.
Feel free to use 2 packages tempeh instead of just 1. At times I like the extra dose of protein the tempeh adds and will double the amount making for an extra hearty chili. It’s just so good!
For those who do not care for the taste of tempeh, I recommend making this a day ahead so the flavors really meld into the tempeh masking most of its natural flavor. Or try using the three grain tempeh as its flavor is not as strong.
If you find if you added too much heat from the chipotle, try adding a teaspoon or so of cocoa/cacao powder or organic sugar.
UPDATED: This recipe was updated in Sept. 2019 with new photos and helpful tips. The only changes made to the recipe was adding a can of sweet corn. Since so many who commented on the recipe added it, I thought I would do the same. It’s delicious, but optional!

Mix dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder and salt.
Combine wet & dry: Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and mix until just combined. Don’t overmix, overmixing the batter tends to make the muffins less tender.
Add blueberries: Toss in the fresh or frozen blueberries and gently fold them into the batter.
Scoop: Fill each muffin-lined hole with batter. For uniformity, fill muffin tin using a 1/4 measuring cup or large ice cream scooper to scoop up the batter and pour into the muffin holes.
Topping: Optionally, add a few strategic blueberries on top and sprinkle the top with a little pure cane sugar or raw sugar. The sugar will add a nice crunch to the tops!
Bake: Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Let cool a few minutes and enjoy warm or at room temperature.

Serve: To serve, add a little sauce to the bottom of your dish, use the back of a spoon to spread the sauce outward a bit making a circular or zig zag motion. Place pasta on top and cover with more sauce, gently toss to coat if you like (if you prefer, toss your pasta and sauce together in the pot and then serve). Top with optional toppings and fresh cracked pepper.
Serves 4 – 6
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for 4 – 5 days, in covered containers. For longer storage, keep in the freezer stored in freezer safe containers or bags. Reheat on the stovetop over low heat until warmed through or in the microwave.

chopped kale, I used 10oz organic package from Trader Joe’s
2 tablespoons of nutritional yeast
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water or veg broth
salt, to taste


","

Instructions


Quinoa: 

Rinse your quinoa under cool running water to remove dust (if you forego this step your quinoa may have a bitter taste).
In medium pot add quinoa, garlic powder pinch of salt and water, bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 15 min.
Once done, uncover, stir and let set for 10 minutes to cool and soak up any excess water.
Fluff before serving. It will be a perfect quinoa, fluffy and sprouted.

Tofu prep:

Open and drain tofu.
Slice tofu into 4 large slabs, or whatever size you prefer.
Press tofu between paper towels or kitchen cloth to remove excess moisture.
In a shallow dish place tofu and tamari and let set while mixing the blackening seasoning, turn after a few minutes to let the other side soak.

Blackened Seasoning:

In a flat bottomed medium size bowl, combine all spice blend ingredients and mix until blended. This is fairly spicy so you may consider using less black pepper and/or cayenne.
Place tofu pieces in spice blend, press gently to get a good coating, turn and repeat on all sides.

Cook tofu:

In saute pan, heat oil over medium-high heat, add coated tofu and cook 5 minutes on each side.

Sauteed Kale:

In large wok or saute pan heat oil over medium heat, add kale and saute for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
Sprinkle nutritional yeast and garlic powder over top, turning and moving the kale around to get all the spices mixed well throughout the kale.
Continue stir frying for another four to 5 minutes, or until bright green and just wilted. You may leave a cover on for a minute here and there in between stir frying to help soften the kale. When kale turns bright green it’s about ready to be removed from heat. Test a piece and see if it’s too your liking, if not saute a little longer. Some may like it crisp and some may like it softer.

Serves 4
For a change, the blackened tofu would also be great with classic sides like this Vegan Macaroni Salad, Vegan Potato Salad or Vegan Cornbread.
Store: Leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, in a covered container.

Instructions


Dipping sauces: Mix your dipping sauce together first, let set so the flavors can mingle. It will taste much different after a few minutes. Taste for flavor before serving.
Water bowl: Fill a large bowl with warm water. Depending on the size of your sheets you can use a shallow pie dish or large bowl or pot.
Wet rice paper: Dip the rice paper in the warm water for just 2 – 3 seconds, it should be stiff, and will soften as you begin to work.
Assemble: On a non-porous work surface, lay the rice paper sheet and layer the ingredients on the edge closest to you at the 1/3 mark. Start with the leafy greens, carrots, cucumber, tofu, red pepper and herbs (really any way you want to layer is fine).
Tuck & roll: After layering the ingredients, ‘tuck and roll’ the edge closest to you, by bringing the edge up and over the fresh veggie mound. Gently but firmly, tuck it under and roll away from you. At the 2/3 mark, fold the ends up onto the roll, and continue rolling tucking them under until the roll is finished.
Serve with choice of dipping sauce.
Makes 6 summer rolls, 2 rolls per serving.
Store: Leftover summer rolls can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days in a covered container and the dressing will last 5 – 6 days. To keep the rolls from sticking together, place a piece of saran wrap, wax or parchment paper between the rolls.

Instructions


Cut Tofu: Remove tofu from the package. Turn tofu on its side and slice in thirds, creating 3 large slabs. Gently press each slab between a clean dish towel or paper towels to remove some of the excess water. Cut the slabs in half. You should have six pieces that look like large domino (rectangular) shapes.
Marinade Tofu: In a medium sized shallow dish, mix together the marinade. Place tofu in the dish and let soak for about 30 minutes – 1 hour turning carefully once or twice in between.
Saute Onions: Once the hour is almost up, caramelize your onions using 1 tablespoon oil. Heat oil over medium heat, add onions, turn down heat to medium low, stir often and cook until they start to brown and caramelize. May take 10 to 15 minutes or so. Once done, set aside.
Cook Tofu: In same skillet, heat remaining oil and cook tofu over medium high heat. Once tofu has browned, about 5 minutes, gently flip and brown the other side. It’s ok if it gets a little crispy too! If you feel it is drying out too much, add some of the juices from the bowl it marinated in for extra moisture. When done, remove from heat.
Build Sandwich: Toast your bread. Spread one side of toast with mustard and the other with a layer of mashed avocado, about 1/2 avocado. Over the avocado, layer your lettuce, tofu, onions and tomato. Top with your other slice of bread.

1 3/4 cup water
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
dash of salt

Toppings

Mango Salsa recipe

","

Instructions


COOK THE CUBAN BLACK BEANS
Instant Pot Method:
*No need to soak the beans.

Add all the ingredients for the cuban black beans, except the vinegar, to the bowl of the Instant Pot and give a good stir. Position lid to lock, and turn the vent valve at the top to its SEALED position.
Press the BEANS/CHILI button, and adjust the mode to NORMAL for soft, tender beans, or MORE for very soft, almost mushy beans. Alternately, press MANUAL, then HIGH PRESSURE and set timer for 30 minutes for soft beans, or 35 minutes for very soft beans. When timer goes off, let pressure release naturally for at least 25 minutes. Carefully turn vent valve to open, let remaining pressure release and remove lid.
Add the 2 tablespoons of vinegar (this step will brighten the overall flavor and I highly recommend not skipping this step). Season with salt & pepper to taste. Beans will soak up the remaining liquids as they cool. Remove bay leaves before serving.

Slow Cooker Method:
*No need to soak the beans.

Add all the ingredients for the cuban black beans, except the vinegar, to the bowl of the Instant Pot and give a good stir. Place lid on top, cook on high for 6 to 8 hours. Will be ready when beans are soft and tender throughout.
Add the 2 tablespoons of vinegar (this step will brighten the overall flavor and I highly recommend not skipping this step). Season with salt & pepper to taste. Beans will soak up the remaining liquids as they cool. Remove bay leaves before serving.

Stovetop Method:
*Soak the beans FIRST. In a large pot, use enough cool water to cover the beans by about 2 inches. Cover with a lid and let soak overnight, or at least 8 hours.

In a large pot or dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon oil or 1/4 cup water (for water saute) over medium-high heat. Add the onion and bell peppers, saute for about 5 minutes. Next, add in garlic, jalapeno, cumin, oregano and olives, cook for 1 minute stirring, stirring frequently. (If you want to skip this step as it’s skipped in the other methods, by all means all the ingredients for the cuban black beans, except for the vinegar and cook as in the next step below.)
Add in the beans, water/broth, bay leaves, cover and bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and cook 50 – 60 minutes. Beans are ready when they are soft and tender throughout.
Add the 2 tablespoons of vinegar (this step will brighten the overall flavor and I highly recommend not skipping this step). Season with salt & pepper to taste. Beans will soak up the remaining liquids as they cool. Remove bay leaves before serving.

COOK THE QUINOA

In a medium pot, place quinoa, garlic powder, salt and water. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes.
Remove from heat, uncover and let rest for 10 minutes. Fluff with fork, set aside.

Alternatively, you can cook the quinoa first using this Instant Pot Quinoa recipe.
SERVE
Serve the beans alongside the quinoa, and top with mango salsa. Add a squeeze of lime over top and add some sliced/diced avocado if you have one hand.
Serves 4 – 6

Instructions


Cashew Sweet Cream: Make your cashew sweet cream, you can use right away or keep in the fridge for a few hours to thicken. Cashew cream can also be made a day or two ahead.
Crust: Make your crust by combining all the ingredients, except water, into a food processor/blender and blend until combined, and somewhat chunky. Add one tablespoon of water, and process until dough forms. Add the extra tablespoon of water if needed (you may find in your climate or altitude that you may not need it). We don’t want the dough too wet, just enough so that it combines nicely. Cover and place in the refrigerator for 20 min to stiffen.
Prep fruit: While dough is setting, prepare your fruits and set aside.
Assemble: Using molds of choice, line each with a piece of saran wrap or cut parchment paper (this will help to remove them so be sure to leave overhanging flaps). Fill each pan with a layer of dough, about 1/4 inch thick, by pressing firmly, yet gently into place. Fill each tartlet with cashew cream, almost to the rim, and level out, top with 1/3 cup of fruit. 
Remove: To remove tart from mold, gently lift the edges of saran wrap or parchment paper, place on a flat surface, and using a spatula carefully wedge under the tart and move to desired flat surface. 
Make ahead: You can prepare these a couple of hours ahead, cover them with saran wrap and store in the refrigerator until ready to eat. Makes 3 three-inch fruit tarts using the mini cake molds. Each fruit tart is about 2 servings.

2 tablespoons coconut oil, vegan butter or pure maple syrup, divided
1 teaspoon ground ginger or finely grated ginger, divided
salt, to taste

optional toppers

shredded unsweetened coconut (add after the first two or three minutes)
dash of cinnamon


","

Instructions


Preheat broiler. You can alternately use a toaster oven for this using a high temp.
Prep grapefruit: Slice grapefruits in half. You may have to slice a tad bit off the bottom if your grapefruits don’t stand straight. Use a grapefruit knife or a serrated paring knife and cut each segment so the pink flesh is cut away from the membrane. Next, gently par around the whole outside area of flesh cutting away from the rind. It will make your grapefruit eating a little easier and less messy.
Assemble: Place each half, cut side up, on a rimmed cookie sheet or baking dish. Top each half with 1 teaspoon or so of coconut oil, 1 teaspoon or so of sugar, and a generous pinch of ginger. Use your fingers to blend and spread the ginger on the grapefruit halves.
Broil: Place under the broiler and cook anywhere from 4 – 7 minutes. I find it best to set your timer for 2 minutes, check grapefruit, if sugar is not caramelized or there is no excessive charring of the grapefruit rind (white part), add another minute and repeat the process until sugar is caramelized and rind is gently colored but not overly burnt all around. If using shredded coconut, sprinkle on top of the grapefruit halves after the first 2 minutes. Once done, sprinkle with salt.

2 tablespoons olive oil
6 cups water or vegetable broth 
3 to 4 tablespoons white miso, to taste
4 cups kale, chopped
pinch of red pepper flakes, garnish
squeeze of lemon, optional
sliced green onions, optional

Preheat oven to 400 degrees
Roast garlic: Remove most outer layer of skin from bulbs of garlic, leaving the most inner layer so they will stay together. Cut off the tops of the garlic bulbs. Place bulbs cut side up on a piece of tin foil large enough to fold over and close tight at the top when done. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over each bulb. Close the tin foil by folding up the edges and squeezing them together at the top and fold over, or bring up the sides and fold over while pinching and folding the ends. Bake for 45 – 50 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes.
Miso soup: In a large pot, squeeze garlic bulbs into the pan and mush it a bit with the back of a wooden spoon. Add liquids, turn heat to medium-low. Add your miso and stir to incorporate the paste. Add in greens and let wilt until deep dark green, about 5 – 10 minutes.

Ingredients



Scale

1 lb. green split peas (about 2 1/4 cups), rinsed and odd peas removed
3 large carrots, chopped
2 celery sticks (some leaves ok), chopped
1 onion, chopped

2 heaping teaspoons herbes de Provence (or 1 teaspoon thyme and oregano)
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon vegan worcestershire sauce, optional
4 – 6 cups vegetable broth or water* (see notes)
mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper, to taste
4 tablespoons fresh parsley, roughly chopped (or 2 – 3 teaspoons dried)


","

Instructions


This soup can be prepared 3 different ways:
Slow Cooker: 

Place ingredients into the bottom of your crock pot, starting with the split peas and finishing with the broth. Heat on low for 7 – 8 hours or high for 4 – 5 hours. Add parsley 30 minutes before done. Let soup cool slightly and remove bay leaves. 
Using an immersion blender, carefully, as to not burn yourself, puree soup until desired consistency. You can also puree using a food/processor or blender, may take two batches. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper as needed. Soup will thicken upon standing.

Stovetop: 

In a dutch oven or pot, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water over medium-high heat, add the onion and saute for 5 minutes. Add carrots, celery, garlic, cabbage and herbs, and saute, stirring frequently, for 3 -4 minutes. Add the split peas, bay leaves, worcestershire sauce and vegetable broth. 
Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Stir in parsley 30 minutes before removing from heat. Let soup cool slightly and remove bay leaves. 
Using an immersion blender, carefully, as to not burn yourself, puree soup until desired consistency. You can also puree using a food/processor or blender, may take two batches. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper as needed. Soup will thicken upon standing.

Instant Pot:

Set Instant Pot to SAUTE and add the 1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water, onion, carrot, celery, and garlic, saute for 4 – 5 minutes (feel free to skip this step entirely).
Add split peas, cabbage, herbs de provence, bay leaves, and at least 5 cups of broth, and stir to combine.
Attach lid and turn to lock, set the valve to SEALING, and manually set to HIGH pressure for 15 minutes. Let natural release for 10 minutes. Remove bay leaves, season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in the parsley.
Using an immersion blender, puree the soup to desired consistency. Alternatively, puree using a food processor or blender (may take 2 – 3 bathes).

Serve: Pair with your favorite artisan bread, or top with crispy roasted chickpeas or coconut bacon.
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 – 6 days. Store in mason jars or to-go containers for easy grab-n-go lunches. Freezes well for up to 2 months, just let thaw before reheating.

1 – 2 tablespoons tamari
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
4 – 5 large leaves of kale, center stem removed and julienned
3 scallions, sliced (divided)
1 – 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast, optional
1 cup kimchi

To Serve, optional

cilantro sprigs
sesame seeds (toasted, black or white)
lime wedges
6 corn or flour tortillas


","

Instructions


Open and drain tofu. No need to press the tofu.
In a large wok or skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add tofu, crumbling between your fingers, cook, stirring occasionally, for about 2 -3 minutes. 
Turn heat to medium, carefully add tamari and garlic powder, give a good stir. Add kale and 2/3 – 3/4 of the scallions, cook, stirring occasionally until kale becomes soft and wilts, cover partially to help with the process, about 5 – 7 minutes. 
Lastly, add the nutritional yeast and kimchi, mix and cook just until kimchi has warmed through, about 1 minute or so. We don’t want to overcook the kimchi or it will destroy some of the health benefits of the probiotics.
If making optional tacos, heat the tortillas. I like to heat mine carefully over a gas burner until lightly charred in spots. Use your preferred method. Layer tortillas with the scramble mixture, add a few sprigs of cilantro, some of the reserved scallions, a sprinkle of sesame seeds and a squeeze of lime.

2 limes, juice of
3 – 4 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Instructions


Dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the apple cider vinegar, lime juice, olive oil, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, ad generous pinch of salt. Set aside. (You can also just pour the ingredients over the assembled salad before tossing, as mentioned in the post, but mixing will help dissolve the spices.)
Prep: Drain and rinse the black eyes peas and black beans. Drain the canned corn, or if using fresh corn cut it off the cobb. Dice the red peppers, jalapeno, and onion. Chop the cilantro.
Avocado: The easiest and quickest way to dice an avocado for this recipe, is to slice it in half, remove the seed, using a knife, score the flesh in to segments, using a cross-hatch pattern, being careful to not break through the skin. Scoop it out using a large spoon, getting as close to the skin as possible, in one swoop.
Assemble: In a large bowl, add the beans, corn, bell pepper, jalapeno, onion, avocado and cilantro. Pour the dressing overtop and toss well to coat. Taste for flavor.
Eat right away, or let the salad rest in the refrigerator for a few hours to let the flavors mingle.
Leftovers will stay fresh for up to 4 – 5 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. I don’t recommend freezing this salad/salad if adding avocado, if planning on freezing, omit the avocado and add it when serving. Freeze for up to 2 months.
Makes about 2 quarts.

Ingredients



Units
USM 

Scale
1x2x3x 




3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, more for dusting
1/4 teaspoon instant yeast
1 teaspoons salt
1 5/8 cups water (1 and 1/2 cups + 2 tablespoons)


","

Instructions


Mix: In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add the water, and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky. 
1st Rise: Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest at least 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature, about 70 degrees.
Shape: Dough is ready when its surface is dotted with bubbles. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it. The easy way is to tilt the bowl and use a rubber spatula to scrap down the sides, turning the dough out onto the floured surface. Sprinkle the dough with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. 
2nd Rise: Lightly sprinkle your parchment paper with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal, and put dough seam side down, dust lightly. Cover with a smooth cotton towel and let rise for 30 minutes – 2 hours. 
Bake: At least a 30 minutes before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Place a 6 to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in the oven so it heats up nice and hot. When ready, carefully remove the pot, uncover, lift the edges of the parchment paper with dough and placed it straight in the pot. Cover with lid, place back in the oven and bake 30 minutes. Remove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf is beautifully browned. Once done, carefully pull bread up using the edges of the parchment paper, let cook on wire rack.
Makes one 1 1/2 pound loaf

pinch of nutmeg, optional
3 tablespoons flour (spelt, all-purpose, or oat)
1 cup vegetable broth
1 cup unsweetened cashew milk (or your favorite plant milk)
mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper, to taste


","

Instructions


Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease with oil.
Onions: Slice onions as uniform as possible and make sure all the pieces are separated. In a large mixing bowl, combine the onions, flour, panko and salt, toss to combine. Spread the onions evenly in a single layer on the baking sheet. Place the baking sheet pan in the oven on the middle rack, and bake until golden brown, approx. 30 minutes. Stir/toss the onions 2 to 3 times during cooking. After about 20 minutes, remove, and set aside, any onions that are cooking too fast. Once done, remove from the oven and set aside. Turn the oven down to 400 degrees F.
Green Beans: Fill a large pot 2/3 full with water and add a generous pinch of salt. Bring the water to a boil, add beans and blanch for 7 minutes. Drain beans into a colander and immediately plunge the beans into a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Drain and set aside.
Mushroom sauce: In a large pan, heat oil over medium-high heat, add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms begin to sweat and release their juices, approx. 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and nutmeg, continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour over and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add the broth and let simmer for 1 minute. Lower the heat to medium-low and add the non-dairy milk. Cook until mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, approx. 6 to 8 minutes.  Taste for seasoning, add more salt + pepper to taste. Remove from heat.
Assemble & bake: Add the beans to the mushroom gravy and give a good stir. Place mixture in a baking dish and top with the baked onions. Place in oven, on the center rake, and bake until bubbly, approximately 15 minutes. If onions start to brown too much, cover with foil. Let cool slightly and enjoy.

Fajitas

2 tablespoons olive oil or 1/4 cup water for water saute
2 bell peppers (any color), cored and thinly sliced
1 small white onion, thinly sliced
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
pinch of mineral salt

To Serve

2 cans (15oz) black beans, drained and rinsed or 3 cups Instant Pot Black Beans
1 batch Cilantro Lime Rice or 3 cups cooked rice
2 heads of romaine, shredded (about 3 – 4 cups)
Corn Salsa
Pico de Gallo
1 – 2 avocados
lime wedges


","

Instructions


The Beans: Start with the beans, I usually make these ahead if making from scratch. If you’re making them fresh, the Instant Po Black Beans will take about 60 minutes to complete. If I don’t want to use homemade, open a can of black beans and simply drain and rinse them.
The Rice: The Cilantro Lime Rice takes about 25 – 30 from start to finish so it’s a good idea to get that started after the beans, unless using canned beans than you can start with the rice.
The Veggies: The fajitas only take about 15 minutes, including prep time, to finish. These can be made while the rice is cooking.

In a large skillet, heat olive oil or water over medium heat. Add the onions, bell peppers, oregano and pinch of salt, and saute for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions and peppers are soft and tender. Remove from heat.

Assemble: To assemble your burrito bowls, in individual bowls add about 3/4 cup of rice, 3/4 cup of beans, 1/4 – 1/3 cup of corn salsa or pico de gallo, and 1/4 of the fajita mixture, along with a handful of shredded lettuce. Add a side of avocado (mashed or sliced), I usually use 1/4 of an avocado per bowl. Top with a squeeze of lime, pinch of salt and a dash of red pepper flakes.
Store: All the leftover components can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 – 4 days. Store individually or together (as for meal prep).

Scale

Strawberries + Coconut Whipped Cream

1 lb. fresh strawberries, tops removed and chopped
2 teaspoons organic pure cane sugar
Coconut whip cream

Shortcake Biscuits

1 cup unsweetened almond milk (use your favorite non-dairy milk)
juice of 1 lemon or 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
3 cups flour (unbleached all-purpose, or half mix with spelt or white whole wheat)
1/4 cup organic pure cane sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon mineral salt
1/2 cup coconut oil, at room temperature or hard (cubed vegan butter is ok too)


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
Vegan Buttermilk: Measure the milk and the juice of 1 lemon or apple cider vinegar, let rest for 5 – 10 minutes to curdle.
Strawberries: Place the strawberries in a medium bowl with 2 teaspoons pure cane sugar and combine. Set aside for at least 20 minutes. The longer they rest, the juicer (more macerated) they will become.
Shortcakes: 
Dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.
Cut the oil (or butter): Add the coconut oil and cut the oil into the flour using a fork or pastry blender. When done flour should be lumpy with little balls of flour.
Combine dry and wet: Pour the vegan buttermilk into the flour mixture and mix to combine. Don’t overmix the dough, mix just until combined.
Flatten dough: Once dough is formed, place it on a lightly floured flat surface. Using your hands, flatten and mold the dough into a circle shape about 1/2 inch thick (a rolling pin will work too).
Cut dough: Cut circles using a 3 inch cookie cutter (a glass is ok too). Dip the cutter in flour before each cut to keep it from sticking. Leftover dough can be reshaped and cut. You should get 12 shortcakes.
Prep for baking: Place the shortcakes on an UNGREASED baking sheet, or lined with a silpat or parchement paper. Make sure the sides are touching each other, this will make them cling to one another, rising bigger and taller.
Garnish biscuits: Brush the tops with a little almond milk and sprinkle with pure cane sugar or turbinado. The sugar will give the shortcake tops a nice crunchy texture.
Bake: Place shortcakes in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Let cool a few minutes before assembling your strawberry shortcakes.
Assemble shortcakes: To serve, slice shortcakes in half, top with strawberries and generous dollop of vegan whipped cream.
Makes 12 strawberry shortcakes.
Store leftover biscuits, covered, on the counter for 4 days. Or keep them stored in the refrigerator for up to 7 – 10 days. You can also freeze them for up to 2 months (let thaw on the counter or in the fridge). Warm them back up in a toaster oven.
NOTES:
Types of flours: My favorite is unbleached all-purpose when making shortcakes. It yields the most tender and fluffiest biscuits. You could also try half all-purpose and half whole grain, just don’t skimp on the oil or butter.
Tips for cutting biscuits:

To keep the dough from sticking to the cutter, keep a small bowl or plate of flour nearby and dip the cutter into the flour, shaking any loose flour away, before making cuts.
Don’t twist the cutter when making cuts, it creates a seal and the biscuits won’t rise as well.

Recipe adapted from Sally’s Baking Addiction
RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT: I love my Silpat or these parchment liners for lining the baking sheet, and these fluted cookie cutters and pastry blender (affiliate links) work great too! For more of my favorite cooking tools, shop my kitchen essentials.

1 tablespoon baking powder
generous pinch of salt
1/3 cup light flavored olive oil, use your favorite oil*
1/3 cup packed light or dark coconut sugar
1 cup unsweetened non-dairy milk, room temperature
juice of 1 small lemon or 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1 – 2 chopped jalapeno peppers, seeds removed and diced, optional


","

Instructions


Prep: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a muffin pan with liners or spray with nonstick spray.
Vegan buttermilk: In a 2 cup measuring cup, add the milk and lemon juice/apple cider vinegar, let rest for 5 – 7 minutes to curdle and make vegan buttermilk.
Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, mix together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
Wet ingredients: To the vegan buttermilk, add the oil and coconut sugar, mix until combined.
Combine: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk until combined. Fold in the peppers. Avoid overmixing.
Bake: Spoon batter into muffin tin holes, filling about 3/4 full. Place in the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Use a toothpick to test for doneness. If it comes out clean, the muffins are done. Let muffins cool a few minutes before removing them.
Makes 12 muffins
Store: Keep leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 4 – 5 days. To store longer, keep them individually wrapped in the freezer for up to 2 – 3 months. Reheat in the microwave.
NOTES:
*Use your favorite neutral oil, even coconut oil in it’s melted state would be delicious. Vegan butter would work well too (I recommend Miyoko’s).
Optional add-ins: Not feeling the jalapeno, instead try 1 cup corn (fresh, canned or frozen), 1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries, 1 cup dried cranberries, 1 cup shredded vegan cheddar cheese, or 1/2 cup crumbled coconut bacon. Feel free to mix and match using your best judgement. Add in after mixing the batter.
Skillet Cornbread: Baking cornbread in a skillet gives it an even heartier, crunchy crust. Bake this cornbread in a 9-inch or 10-inch oven safe greased skillet at the same temperature for the same amount of time.

mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper, to taste
juice of 1 lemon

Homemade Croutons

2 loaf ends, cubed
1 – 2 tablespoons garlic-flavored olive oil (neutral plain oil works great too)
pinch of garlic powder


","

Instructions


Prep veggies: Trim both ends off the leeks, we’ll be using the white and light green parts only. Make a slit down the center lengthwise and run under cool water to remove any debris/dirt that may have collected between the layers. Lay on a flat surface, thinly slice widthwise. Here is a great guide to prepping leeks. Trim asparagus ends and discard. Cut remaining asparagus into 1-inch pieces.
Cook: In a large pot or dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. Add leeks and saute for about 5 minutes, or until softened. Add in tarragon, lentils, asparagus, vegetable broth, and salt & pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer for 15 – 20 minutes. Let cool a bit. 
Puree: Using an immersion blender, puree soup until desired consistency (I left mine a little chunky). You can also puree using a blender or food processor (this method will most likely require you to puree in 2 batches). Once pureed, add back to the stove and add juice of 1 lemon, give a good stir. Add more water as needed to thin, no more than 1 cup should be needed. Taste for seasoning and heat on low as needed to warm.
Croutons: While the soup is cooking or cooling, cube two slices of your favorite bread (I used the end pieces). Place cubes on a small baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil, add a pinch of salt, and toss well to coat. Toast in a toaster oven as if toasting bread (this was my method using the small tray that came with the toaster oven). Alternately, use the broiler in your oven and set it at medium, place the baking sheet under the broiler for 5 – 7 minutes, tossing once or twice, until bread is toasted and slightly golden. Simple and easy croutons!
Serve: Serve soup in individual bowls topped with croutons and fresh cracked pepper. For a little heat, add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. For more herby flavor, stir in a small handful of fresh chopped parsley. For soaking up the juices, a slice of homemade Artisan Bread is perfect!

Quick soak your cashews: To soak your cashew fast, simply place them in hot water for 5 minutes, drain and use accordingly.
I also didn’t add in any salt but feel free to add salt to taste. 
Lastly, I usually use 1 tablespoon of lemon juice in my cashew creams but didn’t add any in this recipe, I didn’t feel it needed either. You may try adding 1 tablespoon if you have it on hand for another layer of flavor.

In a mixing bowl, combine the flour, cream of tarter, baking soda and salt. Set aside.
In a medium sized mixing bowl, using a spoon, mix together the sugar and butter until creamy, about 2  minutes. This can also be done with a stand alone mixer or hand blender (I usually just use a bowl and spoon). Then add the vanilla and applesauce, mix to combine. Add flour mixture and stir just until flour is incorporated. Dough should be firm and thick. If the dough is too soft, chill it in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to 1 hour until it stiffens a bit. This will help keep them from spreading too much.
In a small bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon for rolling. Roll dough into about 1 inch balls. To keep them uniform, use either a 1 tablespoon measuring spoon or 1 tablespoon scooper.
Place cinnamon sugar rolled balls on prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2 inches between balls. Bake in center of the oven for 8 – 9 minutes. For a little crispier cookie, bake for 10 minutes.
Let cool for a few minutes on the pan, they may be too soft just from the oven to move to a wire rack. Once cooled, enjoy!

Add in lemon, stir and you will notice the batter rise and foam a bit. Add in veggies and combine thoroughly. (Note: I don’t really measure the vegetables, so this is an approximation)
Cook: Pour 1/2 of the mixture onto the preheated griddle or skillet. You can use your spatula to move the veggies around and flatten as needed if they are piled up in areas. Also you can help make your pancake round by gently pushing in the edges where needed. There may be times when it appears that you have more veggies than batter, don’t panic….in a few minutes the batter will puff up from the baking soda and fill in making it look fluffy and full. Let cook for 5 minutes. Flip and cook another 5 – 7 minutes, making sure the batter cooks throughout.
Serve with your choice of condiments. A thinned hummus would also be great! Pairs well with fresh fruit on the side.
Makes 2 pancakes
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, in a covered container. Reheat in the toaster oven or microwave.

2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 inch knob ginger, grated or minced
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste


","

Instructions


Drain tofu. Drain the tofu and lay it on its side for a few minutes to let the water drain (above left).
Marinade. In a medium size shallow dish, whisk together the tamari, rice wine vinegar, maple syrup, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, red pepper flakes.
Cube and marinate the tofu. Cut the tofu into 1/2 inch cubes (it doesn’t have to be perfect!). Add the tofu to the marinade and let set for 20 minutes, turning at least once halfway through. The tofu is meant to be served at room temp straight from the marinade. Feel free to warm it up by adding it to the pan while stir frying the veggies.
Noodles. While tofu is marinating, make the soba noodles according to package directions. Rinse well under cool running water to cool the noodles and stop them continuing to cook.
Veggies. Heat sesame oil over medium heat, add the broccoli and carrots, stir fry for 3 minutes. Add a large spoon of marinade, basil and mint, cook another 1 – 2 minutes. I prefer my vegetables to be al dente and will remove from heat as soon as they brighten in color (feel free to cook a little longer if you wish). Also, you can add the tofu, marinade and noodles to the pan, tossing well, to warm through.
Assemble. Serve soba noodle in individual dishes topped with veggies and tofu, and top with remaining marinade, scallions, sesame seeds and additional fresh herbs.
This can be served warm or cooled. I ate this after taking the photos, it was on the cool side but still absolutely delicious!
Serves 2 – 3

1 cup almonds, raw or toasted (old fashioned oats would be ok too)
1 cup medjool dates (about 10), pitted and chopped
pinch of mineral salt

Filling

3 cups raw cashews, soaked for 2 – 3 hours and drained
1/3 cup unsweetened vanilla cashew milk
1/3 – 1/2 cup pure maple syrup
1 heaping teaspoon vanilla powder or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
pinch mineral salt
2 cups frozen or fresh raspberries

Toppings, optional

shaved dark chocolate or cacao nibs
1 – 2 cups frozen or fresh raspberries


","

Instructions


Crust: Place almonds, dates and salt in a food processor/blender, and blend until course. Line a round 8 × 8 or 9 × 9 pan or spring-foam pan with parchment paper or cling wrap. Add the nut crust to the pan and gently press against the bottom and around the corners, filling in as evenly as possible.
Rinse food processor/blender and begin the filling.
Filling: Place the drained cashews, milk, maple syrup, vanilla and salt back in the food processor/blender, blend until smooth scraping down the sides as needed. Be patient and let the machine run a few minutes extra to be sure it’s smooth. Add the raspberries to the filling and fold in by hand using a spatula. Add the mixture to the prepared pan, making sure to spread evenly filling in the entire pan. Gently tap pan on a flat, hard surface to remove air bubbles. Top with optional toppings (you can also add toppings after it’s been frozen).
Freeze: Place in freezer for at least 6 hours to overnight.
Serve: Before serving, pull cake from pan and remove the parchment paper/cling wrap. Let set 5 – 10 minutes before slicing. Enjoy this easy, vegan cheesecake! It’s quite addicting. :)
Keep leftovers in the refrigerator.
Serves 8 – 12
NOTES:
If you’d like to cut down on the nuts, try using old-fashioned oats in place of the almonds when making the crust.
Vary up the crust by adding 2 tablespoons of cacao powder for a chocolate version. Alternately, add in 1/4 cup shredded coconut for a coconut flavor. And, if you feel like making it supreme, add both the cacao and coconut when making the crust for maximum flavor!
Make this raw by using homemade nut-milk.

Slice and press tofu: Remove tofu from package, turn on it’s side and carefully slice into 3 slabs. Place slabs between 2 clean dishcloths or towels, lay a heavy object over top to press out excess moisture. I used my large cutting board but a heavy cookbook will do the job too. Let set under pressure for about 10 minutes.
Saute onions: Peel and cut the ends off the onion, lay onion cut side down and cut in half. Slice onion into thin strips, about 1/8 – 1/4 inch. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet or medium size pan over medium heat. Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until golden and browned on the edges, about 10 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside. If you happen to leave your onions in the pan take note that they may continue cooking from the heat of the pan, pay close attention so they don’t burn too much.
Pan-fry tofu: Heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat in a cast iron skillet or pan. Add tofu and cook without touching for about 4 – 5 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Sprinkle with salt and garlic powder after the first flip.
Prepare bread & avocado: Toast your bread, or not, and slice your avocado. You may even prefer to mash your avocado right in its shell with the back of a fork and spread like butter. I find I use the latter method most often.
Assemble: Layer your sandwich as you like. I layered mine from bottom to top with mustard (dijon and habanero mix), leafy greens, tofu, sauteed onions, salt & pepper, avocado and more mustard. Every bite was so delicious!

Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




5 – 6 small or 2 – 3 large sweet potatoes
1 – 2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 teaspoon mineral salt, or to taste
1 teaspoon chipotle powder or thyme, optional (onion or garlic powder would be great too)

To serve

Garlic Aioli
chopped parsley


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with a silpat or parchment paper. Alternately, grease baking sheet lightly with oil.
Wash and pat dry the sweet potatoes. Remove any unsightly spots. Cut potatoes lengthwise into quarters, and cut those as needed, preferably no larger than 1 inch thick. Place on baking sheet, drizzle with oil and give a good toss. Arrange potatoes in a single layer, sprinkle with salt and optional spice/herb of choice (I used a light dusting of chipotle powder). Place baking sheet in the oven, on the middle rack, and bake for 25 – 30 minutes, turning once or twice.
Remove from oven, let cook a few minutes and serve with a sprinkle of chopped parsley and garlic aioli. For variation try this Sriracha Cream Sauce (Aioli), it’s delicious!
These are best straight from the oven, but cooled isn’t so bad either. If you have leftovers, they’ll still be good the next day.
Store leftovers, in an airtight container, in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

1/2 cup celery (some leaves ok), diced (optional)
1/2 cup green onions (green parts only), diced
1/4 – 1/3 cup dill or sweet relish or finely chopped pickles, optional

Potato Salad Dressing

1/2 – 3/4 cup vegan mayo (store bought or homemade vegan mayo)
1 heaping tablespoon yellow mustard
2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar or juice of 1/2 lemon, optional
1/4 teaspoon ground celery seed
mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper, to taste


","

Instructions


Potatoes: Place potatoes in a large pot, cover potatoes with 1 1/2 inch of water, add generous pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a gentle boil and cook about 15 – 20 minutes, until potatoes are just fork tender. Drain potatoes and let cool. Once cooled, gently peel the skin away (or leave it on if you prefer). Pinch the potato skin with your thumb and forefinger, skin should come off with ease. Cut the potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes. Alternatively, cube the potatoes first, then boil.
Prep veggies: While potatoes are cooking and/or cooling, prepare the green onion, and celery.
Dressing: In a small bowl, combine the mayo, mustard, ground celery seed, salt and pepper, and mix well. If dressing is too thick, add a tad more water or lemon juice.  Alternatively, if dressing is too thin, add more mayo. If using store bought mayo, I like to add 2 tablespoons of water to thin, as store bought may is very thick. 
Assemble: In a large bowl (or pot you cooked the potatoes in) place the potatoes, onion and optional celery. Pour the dressing over top and mix to combine. Season with mineral salt and fresh cracked pepper.
Serve as is, or store in the refrigerator for an hour or so before serving. Garnish with paprika, chives, parsley, dill or even radishes.
Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Ingredients



Scale

4 large poblano peppers
1 block (14 -16 oz.) organic tofu (firm or extra-firm), drained and pressed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, diced (about 1 cup)
8 oz mushrooms, sliced (I used baby bella)
1 small bell pepper, diced (any color)
1 teaspoon garlic powder
a large handful of fresh baby spinach (or chopped large leaf)
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
mineral salt & pepper, to taste

To serve, optional

sriracha cashew cream or vegan aioli
avocado slices


","

Instructions


Roast poblano peppers using one of two ways.

Oven: Roast in preheated oven at 450 degrees for 20 minutes or so on a cookie sheet, turning halfway in between to flip peppers over.
Broiler: Roast your peppers in the broiler. To do this move the broiler pan about 6 inches away from heating element and preheat broiler. Place poblano peppers on a baking sheet and broil, turning often, until tender and blackened all over, 8 to 10 minutes. 

Steam peppers: Transfer to a large bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside to let steam for 10 to 15 minutes.
While peppers are roasting, drain the tofu. No pressing is needed since we’ll cook off most of the moisture, but while prepping the veggies I like to set the tofu on its side in the tub it came in so the excess water will drain.
Tofu scramble: In a large skillet/wok, heat oil over medium heat, add onions, and cook for 4 minutes. Add tofu, crumbling between your fingers, and cook for 3 minutes. Add mushrooms, bell pepper and garlic powder, cook for another 3 – 4 minutes. Add spinach, cook for 2 – 3 minutes, until it starts to wilt. Add nutritional yeast and season with salt and pepper. Gently toss and cook for 1 minute.
Peel and de-seed peppers: Remove any loose skin off the peppers. Make one incision down the length of each pepper and carefully remove seeds. 
Stuff peppers: Scoop tofu mixture into peppers. If the peppers need to be heated, using the same baking dish you cooled the peppers in, place under broiler on low for a minute or two, watching closely so nothing burns.
Serve: Top with a drizzle or dollop of cashew cream and avocado slices. Salsa would also be great. I also loved having some warmed corn tortillas on the side as well.
Serves 4
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, in a covered container. Reheat in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 – 15 minutes. Alternatively,  heat in the microwave for 1 – 2 minutes.

Instructions


Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Place vegetables on baking sheet and sprinkle with mineral salt and garlic powder. Place sheet on middle rack and bake for 40 minutes, stirring once or twice. If using beets, prepare same as above but cook separately on a small baking sheet and place on the bottom rack. Remove the beets earlier if they seem to be cooking to fast.
Quinoa: In the meantime, add quinoa and water to a medium size pot, add a pinch of salt and dash or two of garlic powder. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and cook for 15 minutes. Once done, remove cover and let 10 minutes, fluff with fork.
Dressing: Prepare the dressing by adding the tahini, turmeric, lemon juice, water, salt and garlic powder to a small bowl and mix well. Add more water or lemon juice to thin, add more tahini to thicken.
Serve: In individual bowls place a handful of spinach (chopped if needed), 1/2 cup quinoa and a hearty helping of vegetables & chickpeas. Top with sliced avocado, pepitas and a generous amount of dressing. Enjoy!
Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge. Will last for up to 5 days.
NOTES:
Vary up the dressing by adding 1/2 teaspoon ginger powder for some zing or 1/4 heaping teaspoon cayenne powder for heat. Make a double batch if you’d like since the dressing only serves 3. Leftovers store well in a sealed container in the refrigerator.
Change up the grain using farro, rice or barley. Cook grain of choice according to package.

Leave the beans as is for a ranchero or charro style bean or continue to next step.
Puree or mash the beans. My favorite way to puree the beans is using an immersion blender. You can also mash them using the back of a fork or slotted spoon, or potato masher. But I find the stick blender does the best at breaking down the beans into a nice creamy texture. Use your preferred method.
Warm the beans on low if needed and add the lime juice. Beans will thicken as they cool. Add more water as needed to thin.
Serves 4

1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water or veg broth
1 – 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon garlic powder
mineral salt & pepper, to taste

Instructions


Prep the kale:

Wash and dry the kale leaves.
The kale may need to be trimmed based on personal preferences. You may choose to keep the thick central ribs intact or remove them. For this recipe, I just removed the tougher ends.
Next, stack the leaves on top of each other (if using curly kale you may only be able to do a few leaves at a time). Using a sharp knife, cut the leaves widthwise in to thin strips across the leaves. Once done, give it a quick rough chop.

Saute Kale: Heat oil or water in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or wok over medium-low heat. Add kale and saute for 3 – 4 minutes, stirring frequently.
Add seasoning: Add the nutritional yeast, garlic powder, salt and pepper, continue to cook until kale is wilted and turns bright dark green, about 4 – 5 minutes (shown below).
Serves 3 – 4

1 tablespoon pure maple syrup

Instructions


Cook lentils: In a dutch oven or large pot, add vegetable broth and lentils, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 40 – 45 minutes, most to all liquid should be absorbed. (If most liquid is not absorbed, cooked until it is mostly absorbed. If by chance your liquid absorbs too fast, add a tad more water as needed and continue the process.) Lentils should be overcooked and tender. Set aside to cool, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Mash lentils with the back of a spoon or fork, or roughly puree using an immersion blender or food processor, about 2/3 – 3/4 of the lentil mixture.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Toast walnuts: Spread walnuts on a small rimmed baking pan, place in oven and toast until fragrant, about 10 -15 minutes. Set aside to cool..
Prepare vegetables and apple: Heat oil in a medium size pan over medium heat, add onion, garlic, celery and carrot, saute for about 5 minutes. Add apple, fennel, sage salt & pepper, heat for another 3 – 4 minutes.
Combine everything: Add the sauteed mixture with the lentils and mix. Add flour, oats, walnuts and 1/2 cup apple sauce, mix well to combine. If mixture seems to dry, add a little more apple sauce, mix again. Taste for seasoning adding extra herbs, salt and pepper as needed.
Line a 9 x 5 loaf pan with parchment paper, (this will make for easy removal later), add mixture and press down gently but firmly to remove any air pockets, fill in along the edges as well.
Make glaze: In small bowl, mix together the glaze and spread over top lentil loaf as evenly as you can. Here you can even add a fresh sage leaf in the center of the loaf, it won’t burn, it may roll a bit on the edges, and will add a nice decoration.
Bake: Place loaf in oven, on middle rack, and bake for 45 – 50 minutes. Remove from oven, let cool 10 minutes, remove from pan using the edges of the parchment paper. You may like to mix a bit more sauce and spread over top. Place loaf on serving dish, cut and serve individual slices.
Serving suggestions: Serve with roasted or mashed potatoes, or potato & cauliflower mash, a side of green beans or any combo of roasted brussels sprouts, carrots, butternut squash and beets. A simple fresh green salad with a light vinaigrette is also a great side! Leftovers make for great sandwiches!

Ingredients



Units
USM 

Scale
1x2x3x 




1/4 cup vegan butter or olive oil (I used Miyoko’s Butter)
4 white onions (about 2 lbs)
3 – 4 sprigs of fresh thyme (or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried)
2 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon flour (or arrowroot powder)
3/4 cup dry white wine (can sub with red for full-bodied flavor)
6 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
1/2 teaspoon pepper, fresh cracked black or white
1 baguette, sliced
vegan cheese (I used Miyoko’s Mozzarella)


","

Instructions


Prep the onions. Cut the onions lengthwise, lay cut sides on flat surface and trim the ends. Peel away the outer skin, first thin layer of the onion. Place onion on one of the end cuts and slice lengthwise into thin strips. You should end up with about 2 lbs of sliced onions (about 8 – 9 cups).
Caramelize the onions. In at least a 4 qt. pan, heat vegan butter or olive oil over medium heat, add the onions, thyme, bay leaves, and salt (or salt + pepper). Cook the onions over medium heat, stirring frequently, for about 45 minutes (could take up to 1 hour). Onions are ready when they have softened and turned a deep golden brown.
Add the flour. Sprinkle in the flour, stirring well to incorporate until there are no white streaks, cook for about 1 minute.
Add the wine. Pour in the wine, continue to cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, to reduce the wine.
Add the vegetable broth. Lastly, add the broth and pepper, bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 30 minutes. Season to taste.
Assemble soup bowls. Ladle soup into individual, oven safe, bowls. Add 1 or 2 slices of the baguette on top of the soup, and add a layer of cheese and sprig of thyme. Place bowls on a rimmed baking sheet as shown above right. Alternatively, warm toast the baguette slice with cheese separately following instruction below, adding to the top of the soup when serving.
Bake or broil. Place in a preheated oven set to 350 degrees F. for about 20 minutes. Alternatively, place 5 or 6 inches away from the broiler for about 5 – 7 minutes. The bread should get crispy on the edges, and the cheese will melt and may turn golden and slightly char.
Serve: Soup is best served right away while it’s warm. Alternatively, enjoy the soup as is with crusty bread on the side for dipping.
Serves 4
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator, without the toppings, for 5 – 6 days. To store longer, freeze for up to 2 – 3 months. Let thaw in the refrigerator before reheating.

Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 



Biscuits

2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
pinch of salt
4 rounded tablespoons of vegan butter (I used smart balance w/olive oil)
1 cup unsweetened cashew milk
juice of 1 lemon, about 1 tablespoon

Country Gravy

5 tablespoons olive oil or vegan butter
7 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 vegan sausage, minced (Tofurky or Field Roast), optional
pinch of garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning, optional
1/8 teaspoon nutmeg, optional
4 cups unsweetened cashew milk, at room temperature
mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper, to taste


","

Instructions


Gravy: In a medium sized pot heat oil over medium-high heat, add flour and stir for 2 – 3 minutes, until it turns light golden brown. Add the garlic powder, poultry seasoning and nutmeg, mix well, add in the sausage and stir another minute or so. Mixture will form a ball of sorts. Slowly add the milk and continue to stir, bring just to a boil, reduce heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until gravy has thickened to desired consistency, about 10 minutes. Use the back of the spoon/fork to help break up the sausage if needed. Gravy will thicken a bit more as it cools. Season with plenty of pepper and salt to taste. Set aside with lid on, or slightly askew stirring every now and then until ready to serve. If gravy cools too much, heat over low until warmed.
Biscuits: Make your buttermilk by combining the milk with the lemon juice. Let set for about 10 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly flour a flat surface (use a cutting board, marble slab, etc). Leave a little extra flour on the side for your fingers and the biscuit cutter. Line a baking sheet with a silpat or lightly grease with oil.
In a medium size mixing bowl, add the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt, mix well to combine. Add the chilled butter and cut it into the flour using a pastry blender or the back of a fork. You’ll know it’s ready when the butter is about pea sized and the mixture is crumbly looking. Add in the milk and mix until just combined, making sure there are no flour patches. The dough should form into a rough ball, it should be tacky not sticky. If mixture is too wet & sticky, add a little extra flour and mix just a needed.
Place dough on the prepared floured surface, pat it down into a rough circle or rectangle about 1 inch thick, fold dough onto itself. Repeat 2 more times (this will make for flaky biscuits). Add extra flour to your fingers or dough as needed. Gently flatten the dough to about 3/4 inch thick. Using a 2 1/2 inch cookie cutter, place cutter in the reserved flour, tap the cutter on the flat surface to remove any excess and press the cutter into the dough, repeat. As much as you feel you want to, do not twist the cutter in the dough as it crimps the edges and will interfere with proper rising. Place biscuits on prepared baking sheet, brush with a little olive oil or cashew milk over top if you like. Place in the oven on the middle rack for 15 -18 minutes.
Makes approx. 10 biscuits. You can get 12 if you rework the dough scraps. They won’t be the prettiest biscuits but they’ll still taste great.
Serve: Split the biscuits open face and serve gravy over top. Enjoy often!

1 package (9 oz.) 100% soba noodles (I love these King Soba Noodles (affiliate links))
5 – 6 tablespoons miso (I used red, use your favorite)
4 cups water

garnish

2 scallions, sliced
toasted sesame seeds (raw black and/or white are great too)
handful of greens (pea shoots, sprouts, greens and/or cilantro)


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Roast veggies: Place veggies on a large rimmed baking sheet that’s lightly greased or lined with a silpat or parchment paper. Add a drizzle of oil and toss well. Add a sprinkle of salt over top. Place sheet on the middle rack and cook for about 25 minutes stirring every 10 minutes, vegetables are done when just fork tender.
Noodles: Cook your soba noodles according to the package directions. Be sure to use a large pot filled just under half way when cooking soba noodles. Once the noodles have come to a boil, the water tends to foam up quickly and overflow (ugg, I’ve learned from experience). Pay attention and reduce the heat as needed to prevent the water from boiling over while keeping the water at a gentle rolling boil. Most importantly, when done rinse the noodles right away under cool running water to keep them from cooking (or else you’ll have mushy noodles on your hands).
Miso Broth: Heat your water in a small pan until nicely warmed, but not boiling, (use the pot the noodles were cooked in to save a dish). Remove from heat, add miso and mix until miso is dissolved. This keeps the miso from overheating and killing the beneficial probiotics. You can opt to keep it on the burner on low to keep warm until veggies are done.
Assemble soup: Add noodles and vegetables to your serving bowl, top with broth and add a few of the garnishes. Some other optional garnishes would be a dash or two of sriracha or red pepper flakes.
Serves 2 – 3

3 acorn squashes, cut in half lengthwise and seeds removed
olive oil (to roast oil-free see notes)
1 teaspoon thyme, divided
sea salt

Wild Rice Medley

1 cup wild rice, dry (I used half black wild rice and half long grain brown rice)
1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water 
1 medium/large red bell pepper, diced
1 small onion or 1 large shallot, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
8 oz. mushrooms (about 2 cups), sliced
2 large handfuls baby spinach (baby kale or chard is great too, or a combo)
1 can cannellini beans (15 oz), drained and rinsed
1 teaspoon thyme (dried or fresh)
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional
sea salt and cracked pepper to taste


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or silicone mat. In an ovenproof saucepan, fill halfway with water and place on the bottom rack (this will give a little steam to your squash). 
Prep and roast the squash: Cut and seed your squash, place on baking sheet with cut side up. Brush each half with a little oil, and season with a sprinkle of thyme, salt and pepper. Place in the oven and bake for 40-45 minutes, until tender, knife should easily pierce the flesh. If by chance your squash is done first, cover with foil to keep it from drying out.
Rice: Cook your rice according to package directions. Wild rice will take about the same time as the squash to cook, about 40-45 min. Set aside.
Veggies: In large pan, heat oil on medium heat. Add onion and cook for 5 minutes, add garlic and cook 1 minutes. Add the mushrooms, bell peppers, thyme, red pepper flakes, a few twists of salt and pepper, cook for another 5 minutes or so, until the mushrooms start to sweat and soften. Add the beans and leafy greens, stir frequently until they are wilted and warmed through (you may also want to use a cover in between stirring to help soften the greens). 
Wild Rice Medley: Combine the rice and sautéed vegetables in the larger of the two pots. Taste for seasoning adding additional salt and pepper as needed.
Stuff: Scoop mixture into each acorn squash half and serve with any additional seasonings. I actually like to top mine with some sriracha for that extra heat and flavor I love so much. :)
Serves 6 (or 3 for the hearty eaters).
Store: Leftovers can be kept in an airtight container in fridge for up to 4 – 5 days.
NOTES:
Quinoa or quinoa/rice combo would be great too and add even more protein per serving.
To make this oil free, omit the oil when roasting the squash and roast the squash cut side down to keep the moisture in. You can still add a little salt and pepper, and place a sprig of thyme underneath so the flavor with infuse the squash a little. Use water in place of oil when sauteing the vegetables.
RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT: I love my Silpat or these parchment liners for lining this rimmed baking sheet (affiliate links). For more of my favorite cooking tools, shop my kitchen essentials!

juice of one orange + orange halves
himalayan salt and pepper to taste

Garnish

diced tomatoes
onion
vegan sour cream
lime wedges


","

Instructions


Soak beans: The night before, rinse beans in colander with cold running water. Pick through and remove any broken or shriveled beans. Place beans in large pot with 5 or 6 cups water and cover to soak overnight.
Pre-Cook Beans: Next day, drain beans and rinse again. Place beans back in pot, add water, bring to a boil and simmer covered for 1 hour, drain and rinse.
Orange: Juice the orange and set the juice aside. Reserve the orange halves for the soup.
Cook Soup: To the pot of freshly cooked beans, add the bay leaves, garlic, cumin, paprika, onion, celery, carrots, bell pepper, water/broth, orange halves, salt and pepper, reserving the orange juice for later. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 40 minutes to one hour, or until beans and vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Add extra water as necessary (I used another 1 cup of water).
Puree: Once beans are tender, remove the orange halves and bay leaves. Use an immersion blender to blend soup to desired consistency. I blended about 3/4, leaving some chunkiness. You could also use a food processor/blender (this method may take two batches to complete). Blending is optional, you may like it chunky as is. Add the orange juice to the pureed soup and cook another 5-10 minutes.
To Serve: Serve alone or over a bed of cooked buckwheat, farro or brown rice. Top soup with a dollop of Sour Cream, Lime Cilantro Cashew ‘Sour Cream’ or Paprika Cashew Crema. You may also like to top it with diced onion, tomatoes, bell peppers, avocado, jalapenos, a squeeze of lime and/or cilantro.

optional side of veggies

5 – 6 kale leaves, stem removed and chopped
1/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes
8 oz mushrooms, sliced
generous pinch red pepper flakes, to taste

Instructions


Alfredo Sauce: Remove any leaves and core the bottom of the cauliflower. Cut cauliflower into large florets and place in pot of boiling water. Cook for about 20 minutes, or until soft, drain. While cauliflower is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in saute pan over medium to medium high heat, add shallots and cook until soft and lightly browned.
Place cooked cauliflower in blender/food processor along with beans, milk, shallots and nutmeg. Blend until creamy. Taste for flavor adding salt, pepper and any other spice you might like. Also, if sauce is too thick add a splash or so more milk (or water) as needed, blend again.
Veggies: In same saute pan you cooked the shallots, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add mushrooms, kale, sun-dried tomatoes and red pepper flakes. Saute kale until it has sweated down, approx 5 min. You could use a cover to help. Turn off heat when done.
Pasta: Cook according to package instructions.
Assemble: Place cooked pasta back to the same pot it was cooked in, add as much sauce as you like. Stir gently to coat. Add a tad more sauce if needed. Alternately, add the veggie mix to the pasta and mix. Turn heat to low and cook until warmed through adding a splash or so of milk if needed to keep from drying out. We want to keep it moist and creamy.
Pairs well with this Artisan Bread!
Store: Keep remaining sauce or any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge. Will last up to a week. When reheating, add more non-dairy milk to maintain creaminess if needed.

Instructions


HAND CUT METHOD: 

Preheat oven to 400 degrees if slicing by hand. (if julienning see baking instructions below)
Wash your potatoes and remove any unsightly areas. 
Hand cut: Slice the sweet potato in half, place flat side down and cut thin slices, about 1/4 inch thick or smaller. Then turn your thinly sliced pieces on their side and do the same as before cutting thin slices. Try to get them as uniform in thickness as possible so they cook evenly. You may have to go through after cutting and double check your work.
Assemble: Place potatoes on your rimmed cookie sheet/s (I used two), add a small amount of olive oil (about 1 tablespoon), toss gently to coat. Place potatoes in a single layer, preferably spread out so they don’t touch much, sprinkle with mineral salt and seasoning of choice. 
Bake: Place in the oven for 15 minutes, remove sheet/s and rotate positions, bake for another 15 -20 minutes. Keep an eye on them after 15 minutes so they don’t burn. You may lose some, and ending cooking times will greatly depend on your oven. Allow to cool a few minutes. They will crisp up as they cool.
Best served immediately with choice of condiments.

JULIENNE METHOD:

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. (They will be a bit thinner and should be baked at a lower temp but for the same amount of time as if slicing by hand.)
Wash potatoes and remove any unsightly areas. 
Julienne: Trim the ends if you like (I usually skip this step). Julienne your sweet potato.
Assemble: Place on cookie sheet, you may need two, toss with oil, spread in a single layer as much as you can, and sprinkle with spices.
Bake: Place in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Turn sheet around and rotate positions. You can also use a fork and lift the shoestring fries up moving them around a bit. Bake for another 15 – 20 minutes, careful towards the end as they may cook and burn quickly at this point. Keep an eye on them, removing any pieces that are too brown. You may lose some, and ending cooking times will greatly depend on your oven. Allow them to cool a few minutes, they will crisp up a bit.

Cook: Add enough oil to coat the griddle/skillet. Using a 1/4 measuring cup, scoop batter and place on griddle. Let cook about 3 minutes, edges will bubble slightly and start to look leathery, flip and cook another 3 minutes. Add oil to the griddle/skillet, and repeat until batter is gone.
Place finished pancakes on the warm cookie sheet, place in the oven to keep warm while cooking the remaining pancakes.
Serve with pure maple syrup. Adding 2 tablespoons of chopped pecans over top will add protein and texture.
Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or keep in the freezer for up to 2 months. Reheat in the microwave or toaster oven.
Makes about 6 – 8 pancakes, serving 3 – 4.

1102,https://simple-veganista.com/apple-nachos/,HEALTHY APPLE NACHOS (5-MINUTE),"


Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




2 apples of choice
1/4 – 1/3 cup natural nut butter (peanut, almond, sunflower, etc.)
small handful chocolate chips (I used Enjoy Life Mini Chips)
small handful shredded coconut
small handful slivered almonds, optional
sprinkle of cinnamon
1 tablespoon lemon juice

Optional toppings:

hemp hearts
cacao nibs
raisins or currants
ground cardamom
pure maple syrup


","

Instructions


Apples: Wash, core and cut your apples into 1/4 inch slices. I like to cut mine into quarters, take a small paring knife and carefully remove the core and upper and lower end where dirt may still be collected (even after washing). Lay apple quarters on a flat surface with the inside of the apple facing up, carefully slice your apple into 1/4 inch slices, even 1/2 inch slices is good too. Whatever thickness you prefer, no rules here! Place apple slices in a small bowl with the lemon juice, toss to coat.
Nut butter: Heat your nut butter just until warmed and somewhat runny. I like to heat mine by using a small silicon bowl placed in a small pot with just enough water to reach half way up the side of the silicon bowl, heat water on low and gently heat the nut butter until warm and drizzable. Alternatively, warm in the microwave for 20 – 30 seconds.
Assemble: On a serving plate, lay your apple slices in a single layer around the outside edge, then layer another small layer over those but towards the inside center of the plate (like shown in the picture above). Drizzle the nut butter in a circular motion, from the middle of the plate to the outside edge. You can also just zig zag the almond butter from one side to the other if you like. Again, no rules – just do what you feel is best! Top with chocolate chips, coconut flakes, almonds and sprinkle of cinnamon (or whatever you’ve chosen to use as your toppings).
Serves one generously, or two as a small plate.
Enjoy this simple yet delicious treat!

Ingredients



Units
USM 

Scale
1x2x3x 




1 cup long grain rice (my fav is basmati or canilla)
2 cups water
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 bay leaves
1/2 teaspoon mineral salt
1/2 bunch cilantro, chopped (leaves and a few stems)
2 – 3 limes, juice of (about 2 – 3 tablespoons)


","

Instructions


First step: To rinse the rice or not? It is recommended to rinse rice before cooking to remove any loose starches that may make your cooked rice to become gummy. I almost never do this, but if you find your rice does become gummy, you may need to make a habit of it. If using canilla rice, which calls for skipping this step to keep all the nutrients, I’ve never had a problem with gumminess using this rice.
Stovetop: Add the rice, water, garlic powder, bay leaf and salt to a medium sauce pan, add the water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook over a gentle boil for 18 – 20 minutes. Remove from heat, remove cover and let rest for 5 – 10 minutes. Remove bay leaf. Add the cilantro and lime, and fluff with a fork. Taste for salt and add more lime or cilantro to taste.
Rice Cooker: Add the rice, water (see manufacturer’s instructions for amount), garlic powder, bay leaf and salt to the bowl of your rice cooker. Pour the water overtop and cook according to manufacturer’s manual. Once the rice is finished, remove bay leaf. Let cool a few minutes, add the cilantro and lime juice, fluff with a fork. Taste for salt and add more lime or cilantro to taste.
Instant Pot: Add the rice, water and salt to the bowl of your instant pot. Attach the lid and turn to lock the lid. Set the steam valve to SEAL. Cook white rice for 4-8 minutes. If using other rice, see this instant pot cooking chart. Allow the pressure to release naturally for 10 minutes and then carefully release any remaining pressure.
Serves 4
Store: Leftover rice can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 – 5 days, kept in an airtight container. If planning on storing leftovers, be sure to cool it quickly and store it within 2 hours to avoid bacteria growth. To keep longer, store in the freezer using freezer safe containers or baggies for up to 2 months.
To Reheat: Add a splash of water over the top to loosen the clumps of dried grains. Reheat the rice in a pot over medium-low heat on the stovetop, stirring occasionally until heated through. Or heat in the microwave, covered, using 30 second intervals, stirring after each interval, until rice is warmed through.

1 tablespoon gochujang, or to taste (optional)

To garnish

1 nori sheet, thinly sliced
2 scallions, thinly sliced (pale green + green parts only)

Instructions


Rice: Cook the rice according to package directions. For best results, use day old rice.
Stir-fry: In a wok or pan, heat the oil over medium-high heat, add the garlic and ginger, cook until fragrant, about 30 – 60 seconds, stirring frequently. Add the rice, kimchi and frozen veggies, give a good mix, add the tamari and optional gochujang, stir fry for 3 – 4 minutes, or until most of the liquids have been absorbed. Taste for flavor, adding more tamari or chili pepper flakes.
Serve: Spoon into individual bowls with sliced nori sheets, scallions and sesame seeds.

Carpaccio

8 plums (any color)

Lemon Ginger Cream

1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked for 2–3 hours
3 – 4 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
1 heaping teaspoon grated ginger (I used a microplane to grate)

Simple Syrup

2 medjool dates, pitted (fresh is best)
1/3 cup water

OR…

1/3 cup pure maple syrup (in place of dates and water)
1/2 vanilla bean, scraped or 1/2 teaspoon vanilla (or both if you like)


","

Instructions


Ginger Cream: Combine ingredients in a small blender (I used the magic bullet) and blend until smooth. You will want it to be on the thick side and shouldn’t need any additional water. But if you forgo the soaking process, you may need to add a bit more. I suggest adding in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or water at a time. If you find your cream is a bit too runny, add in a few cashews and blend. You can serve at room temp or refrigerate a bit before serving. The cream can be made a day or two ahead of time.
Simple Syrup: Combine either the dates, water, and vanilla OR maple syrup and vanilla into a small blender (I used the magic bullet) and blend until smooth. Feel free to add a tad bit more water as needed to thin if using dates. You can serve at room temp or refrigerate a bit before serving. The simple syrup can be made a day or two in advance.
Plums: Slice your plums thinly just before serving. I have given a more detailed way of slicing above. Here is the simple version: I placed my plums on a flat surface with the stem side up and sliced as thinly as I could by hand with a sharp knife starting from the outside and slicing in until I came to the seed in the middle. Do this for both sides.
Assemble: Place the plums however you like on your plate. Serve with a nice drizzle of the simple syrup and a dollop of the lemon ginger cream. Garnish with optional mint leaves.

Store leftover pesto in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Use the pesto for pasta, as a dip for vegetables, as a spread for sandwiches, thin it out with water or lemon juice and make a dressing for salads, etc. Lots of ways to use pesto.
NOTES:
Use almonds in place of pepitas if needed. I used raw pepitas instead of toasting them.For the garam marsla, if pairing this with regular pasta I would leave it out. It pairs well with the freshness of the carrot & zucchini ribbons. Also, I found that it tasted fine with almond parmesan. But like I said earlier, I can eat some really unusual combinations. If you feel like experimenting, try it out…if in doubt, skip it.

Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 



Taco Nut Meat

1 cup walnuts
1 cup mushrooms (I used baby bellas)
1 tablespoon tamari, soy sauce or coconut amino’s
1 tablespoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder

Spanish Quinoa

1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water
1/2 onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced (any color is ok), optional
1 – 2 cloves garlic, minced or 1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
1 tablespoon tomato paste or 1 cup diced tomatoes
2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth or water
salt + pepper, to taste

To Serve

6 corn tortillas or 6 leaves butter, romaine or other large leafy greens for raw taco wrap
Black Bean Corn Salad (use half recipe)
cilantro, to serve
lime wedges, to serve
pico de gallo (use pre-packaged for convenience), to serve
avocado slices, to serve
hot sauce – tapatio, sriracha or your favorite hot sauce, to serve (optional)


","

Instructions


Spanish quinoa (serves 6):

In medium size pan or skillet, heat oil over medium high heat, add onion, optional bell pepper and cook for 3 minutes, add quinoa and garlic, cook another 5 minutes or so stirring frequently until quinoa starts to get toasty and turn slightly golden. 
Add water, tomato paste, oregano, salt + pepper, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. 
When done, remove cover, fluff with the a fork, and let set for 15 minutes to absorb the rest of the liquids. Taste for seasonings before serving.

Nut meat (makes 6 tacos): 

Place all ingredients in food processor/blender and pulse until you have chunky crumbles. Don’t over process or you will have a nut mushroom pate, which wouldn’t be so bad but we want a crumbly effect here. For visual steps, see this Walnut Meat recipe.
Optionally, heat the nut meat on low just until warm in a small saucepan. You don’t want to overheat or the mushrooms will cook too much, just slightly warm it. I find both ways, warm and room temp, to be just as appealing. Makes enough for 6 tacos.

Warm your tortillas on the griddle or skillet for 30 seconds per side.
Serve: Put your plates and tacos together as you wish! You may find that you end up combining the black bean salsa with the Spanish fried quinoa. You may also find yourself making tacos out of both of those side dishes as well. However you craft your plate, enjoy!

Romesco Sauce: In a food processor/high-speed blender, add almonds and pulse or process until roughly chopped. Add in the bell peppers, garlic, broth/water, vinegar, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt. Blend until desired consistency. Taste for flavors and adjust as needed. You may find you need a little more salt, especially if you’ve used water instead of vegetable broth.
Combine: Bring the pasta and peas back to the pot they were cooked in. Add the romesco sauce and gently mix until pasta is well coated. Warm mixture over low heat if needed.
Serve with a sprinkle of almond parmesan and chopped herbs of choice. Enjoy!
Serves 4 – 6

Instructions


Prep: Start with chopping, dicing and mincing the onion, garlic, ginger and serrano chili. This is pretty much the most work you’ll have to do. I grated my ginger using this handy fine grater (affiliate link), but simply mincing your ginger is great too.
Saute: In a dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat and saute the onions until translucent, add the garlic, ginger, chili and spices and saute for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Cook: Add the chickpeas, tomatoes, cinnamon stick and 1/4 cup of water, turn heat to low and simmer at a gentle boil for 15 – 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a little more water if you prefer a saucy chickpea stew. Remove cinnamon stick and stir in the lemon juice.
Serve: Serve with grain of choice and optional garnish. And for scooping and soaking, this easy Vegan Naan is perfect!

Heat oil over medium heat, add mushrooms and season with a pinch of salt. Simmer mushrooms, stirring occasionally, until liquid is almost evaporated, about 15 minutes.
Add flour, continue cooking and stirring for about 3 – 5 minutes, at least until the flour has been absorbed and not white anymore. Add 1 cup of broth, stirring/whisking briskly until incorporated and liquid has thickened, there should be no flour lumps, about 5 minutes. 
Slowly pour in the remaining broth and mix thoroughly. Season with black pepper and thyme. Simmer at a gentle boil over medium-low until thickened, about 20 minutes, stirring often. Gravy will thicken upon standing. Taste for flavor, adding more salt and pepper as needed.
Makes about 4 cups.

Instructions


Quinoa: In small pot over medium high heat, add broth/water and quinoa, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. Once done, remove cover, fluff with a fork and let set for another 15 minutes to cool and absorb remaining water.
Flax egg: While the quinoa is cooling, start your flax egg by mixing the ground flax seed with 3 tablespoons water in a small bowl and set aside to thicken, at least 10 minutes for best results.
Rémoulade: Place all ingredients in a blender/food processor, except the dill, and blend until smooth (the Nutri Bullet is a perfect tool for this job). If your mixture is too thin add a few cashews and blend again, and if too thick add 1 tablespoon water at a time until desired consistency. Stir in the dill by hand. Taste for seasoning adding more of whatever you like. Cover and keep at room temp or place in the refrigerator until ready to use (I served mine at room temp). This can also be made a couple days in advance and kept in the refrigerator (will stay fresh for up to 5 – 6 days).
Quinoa Cakes: In a medium bowl, combine quinoa, flax egg, flour, onion, celery, bell pepper and garlic. Mixture should be moist enough to stick together. Add additional flour or water, 1 -2 tablespoons at a time if needed to adjust consistency. Taste for seasoning. Scoop up 1/4 – 1/3 cup of mixture and form into a ball, pack them well while forming into a ball. Gently flatten to about 1/2 inch and pinch any cracks that appear on the sides and tops. (Patties can be made a day in advance and kept in the refrigerator.) Be patient and rinse your hands after forming each patty, it will be a bit messy for the first few until you get the hang of it.
Cook: Preheat oven to 200 degrees. In a skillet or shallow pan, heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil over medium heat, add 4 patties and cook, until nicely browned on each side, about 4 – 5 minutes per side. Repeat until all patties are cooked. Keep finished quinoa cakes on a baking sheet in the preheated oven until all cakes are cooked. (see notes for baked option)
Serve the quinoa cakes with a nice dollop of rémoulade and pair with a steamed vegetable of choice. Would be great with vegan mac and cheese, coleslaw or sweet corn & arugula salad too.
Makes 8 – 9 patties, serves 4

Cutting them away will make it easier to coat the inside, but if leaving a few leaves make sure there are a few holes to drizzle the tahini sauce through.
Coat bottom: Drizzle a few tablespoons of tahini sauce in and around the underside of the stem area. If leaves are still attached, make sure to get into the holes to coat the inside of the cauliflower head.
Coat top: Place the cauliflower, stem down, into the pot. Drizzle the top of the cauliflower with ¼ cup of tahini sauce and brush to coat the entire head, adding more as needed. Top with a light sprinkle of salt.
Roast: Cover the pot and place in the oven on the middle rack for 25 minutes. Remove cover and roast for 25 – 30 minutes. If you prefer more charring, place under the broiler for the last 5 minutes. Let cool a few minutes.
Transfer: Carefully lift up the cauliflower using two large forks and place on a plate or platter (or slice and serve from the pot). Top with parsley. Slice into serving portions with a knife. It should be tender enough to slice with ease.
Serve with remaining tahini sauce and chopped parsley.
Serves 4
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days in an airtight container. For longer storage keep in the freezer for up to 2 – 3 months. Reheat from frozen or thawed in the microwave or oven.

1 tablespoon cumin
2 teaspoons coriander
himalayan salt, to taste

Instructions


Soak chickpeas: If starting with dried beans, place the dried chickpeas in a large bowl and fill with fresh purified water. The beans will double in size so be sure to cover and leave plenty of extra water for them to soak up, about 2 to 3 times as much water. Soak for 8 -12 hours. Rinse and drain thoroughly. 
Let beans sprout: Place the chickpeas in a mason jar with a sprouting lid (or sprout them using a colander). Leave the chickpeas anywhere at room temp and rinse and drain them 2 – 3 times a day for 2 to 3 days. If your garbanzo beans are not sprouting, try moving them to a warmer area. Here is a great guide to sprouting garbanzo beans from the Sprout People for reference.
Hummus: Place the ingredients into a food processor or high-speed blender and process until creamy.d You may need to stop every now and then to scrape down the sides. Taste for flavor, adding anything extra you like – garlic, tahini, lemon, spices, or salt. If adding more water, add 1 tablespoon at a time until desired consistency.

1/3 cup goji berries

Instructions


Place ingredients in your large jar, attach the lid and shake, twist and roll until evenly distributed. If using a large bowl, stir mixture and add to container of choice.
How to eat muesli:
Pour and serve: When ready to serve, add 1/2 – 3/4 cup of muesli to your bowl, add enough milk to cover and let set for about 5 minutes or so, until the oats soften a bit. Add a little sweetener of choice (I use a drizzle of maple syrup) and some fresh berries such as blueberries, raspberries, blackberries. Sliced strawberries and/or bananas would also be great. If you have dried mulberries on hand, throw some in as they taste great! When ready to eat, add a little extra milk as needed. Once you’ve made this a few times, you’ll find your perfect way.
Overnight muesli: Add about 3/4 cup muesli to a mason jar or bowl, top with fruits of choice if you like, and cover with milk. Seal or cover and keep in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 3 days (you can make a few so they’re ready to grab and enjoy, or take along with you). Mix before eating, add a little extra milk as needed (if at all).
Makes about 7 cups serving approx. 9 – 14
NOTES: 
Feel free to add 1/2 cup of flaked or shredded coconut. You can change up the dried fruit by adding dried cranberries, chopped dates, cherries or apricots etc. Add any nuts and seeds you prefer. Slivered almonds are great in the mix. Mix and match as you like making this your own!
If you’re not going to top with any fresh fruit, feel free to add in another 1/2 cup or so of dried fruit of choice. Suggested ratio:

5 cups rolled oats

Roast 1: Place in the oven on the center rack and bake for 25 minutes (if using larger potatoes cook 30 – 35 minutes).
Smash: Carefully remove the sheet pan from the oven, using a flat bottom item (I used the bottom of a 1 cup measuring cup) or back of a big spatula, smash potatoes. Smash to about 1/2 inch, a little smaller if you can without them falling apart too much. Gently use a fork to help remove potatoes that may stick to your smasher of choice. It’s ok if they fall apart a little, they should crisp up and stick together once finished. 
Roast 2: Place potatoes back in the oven and continue to bake for an additional 20 – 25 minutes, until edges are deliciously golden and crispy looking. Bake longer if you prefer very crispy potatoes!
Serve: Place potatoes on individual plates and drizzle with sauce and top with greens. Or serve however you like!

Ingredients

USM 

Scale
1x2x3x 




1 block (14 – 16 oz.) organic tofu (super firm, extra firm or firm), cubed
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil (sesame or grapeseed)
1/4 cup tamari, soy sauce or coconut amino’s
1/4 cup water or veggie broth
3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
2 teaspoons cornstarch (tapioca or arrowroot flour is fine too)
1 – 2 tablespoons fresh cracked pepper
3 – 4 cloves garlic, minced or 1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 1/2 inch knob ginger, minced
1 bunch scallions, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 – 2 chili’s peppers, sliced and seeds removed or 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 bunch cilantro, roughly chopped, to serve


","

Instructions


Prep tofu: If not using one of the tofu’s mentioned above, you’ll want to drain and press your tofu to remove excess water. Simply cut tofu into slabs and place between paper towels or a clean dish cloth. With wrapped tofu laying on a flat surface, place a heavy book/object on top for about 15 minutes or so. Here’s a great tutorial from Olives for Dinner: How to press tofu perfectly in six steps.
Stir-fry sauce: In a small bowl, combine the tamari, water, sweetener and flour. This will be your slurry, ensuring your tofu will be coated nicely.
Cook tofu: Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over medium high. Add tofu and cook, stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes, or until golden on all sides. It doesn’t have to be perfect.
Add remaining ingredients: Add in your slurry mixture, ground pepper, garlic and ginger. It will sizzle at first when adding the liquids. Stir fry another 3 minutes or so, add in hot peppers and scallions. Liquids should start to thicken a bit, cook another 5 minutes or until the scallions are just softened.
Serve: Pair with brown rice, brown rice/quinoa mix, basmati or jasmine rice. Soba noodles would be great too. Add a large handful of chopped cilantro on the side, it will add to the flavors while giving a nice dose of freshness to the pepperiness. If you love cilantro, you will truly appreciate it here!
Serves 3
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 – 6 days, in a covered container.

1 3/4 cups (210 g) spelt flour (whole wheat, unbleached all-purpose, or gluten free blend), see notes
1/3 cup (75 g) organic pure cane sugar (or 1/2 finely chopped dates)
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
pinch of mineral salt
1/3 cup (75 ml) neutral flavored oil (or coconut oil in liquid state, vegan butter at room temp or applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Add the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt, and mix well, but don’t overmix, just enough until the flour is combined. Batter will be slightly thick and a few lumps is ok. If mixture seems too thick, add milk, especially if using heavier flours such as whole wheat or whole spelt (you’re more inclined to need it).
Pour batter into a greased loaf pan. Bake for about 50 min – 1 hour. Ovens vary, mine usually takes 50 minutes. You can also do the toothpick test in the center of the loaf, if it comes out clean it should be ready. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 min before slicing.

Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




1 1/2 cup lukewarm water (100°F – 110°F)
1 tablespoon pure cane sugar
1 packet instant or active dry yeast (about 2 1/2 teaspoons)
3 3/4 – 4 cups flour (all-purpose, spelt, whole wheat or combo)
1 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 cup baking soda
olive oil or vegan butter (melted), for brushing
pretzel salt or any course salt as topping


","

Instructions


Start yeast: In a large bowl, pour warm water and sugar, stir to mix, sprinkle with yeast and let sit for 5 – 10 minutes, yeast should become foamy. Alternatively, use the bowl of food processor or stand alone mixer, fitted with a dough attachment. Also, instead of using a spoon to mix, use a hand blender with dough attachment.
Make dough: Add 2 cups flour to yeast, mix until combined. Add salt and rest of flour, mix until combined, about 60 – 90 seconds. If using processor or mixer, beat on medium-low until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 1 1/2 minutes. If dough is too dry add more water 1 tablespoon at a time and if dough is too wet, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time (this may all depend on weather conditions). Transfer to a lightly floured board and knead about 3 minutes, or until somewhat smooth.
Let dough rest: Sprinkle the top of the dough with a little flour and cover with a kitchen towel. Let rest for about 10 minutes, up to 1 hours. 
Heat oven to 425 degrees. 
Grease baking sheet with olive oil, or line with parchment or silicone mat and lightly grease (this ensures your pretzels don’t stick), set aside.
Roll dough: Knead the dough three to four times, slice in half using a sharp knife or pizza cutter. Roll and shape each half into a log, about 10 inches long. Cut 1 inch pieces.
Baking soda bath: Fill a large pot (at least 4 quart) with 2 inches of water (about 8 – 10 cups). Bring to a boil. Add baking soda, it will foam up so be gentle when adding. Reduce to medium; place half of the bites in the water and poach for 30 seconds. They will sink and rise, once risen they should be ready. Use a slotted spoon to transfer pretzel bites to baking sheet. Continue until all pretzels are poached.
Bake: Using a silicone brush, coat the pretzel bites with olive oil or vegan butter, and add a sprinkle of salt over top. Bake until golden brown, 12 – 16 minutes (oven may vary).
Makes about 18 – 20 pretzel bites
Pretzels are best when eaten right away or the same day.
Serve plain or with your favorite accompaniment. I used dijon and whole grain mustard.
Store: You can keep leftover pretzels at room temperature, lightly covered, for up to 3 days. They may soften after storing.

2 zucchini (1 per person), cucumber would be good too

Pesto (serves two)

2 small zucchini or one large
2 cups fresh basil
2 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons tahini
1/2 teaspoon himalayan salt, or to taste

Place all ingredients in food processor/blender and process until finely chopped.

Instructions


Wash and dry your squash. Trim ends off. Cut squash in half lengthwise, scrap out seeds and cut into 1/4 – 1/2 inch thick slices.
Roast your squash 1 of 2 ways:

 Oven: Preheat oven to 500 degrees f. . Place squash on baking sheet, or two if needed, and use just enough oil to lightly coat squash on both sides. Spread squash in an even layer so as to not touch. Sprinkle with mineral salt. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from oven, using tongs or spatula flip squash over and bake another 8 – 10 minutes, or until both sides are nicely browned (your oven may vary).
 Broiler: Set broiler to medium. Place squash on a baking sheet, use just enough oil to lightly coat squash on both sides. Spread squash in an even layer so as to not touch. Sprinkle with mineral salt. Place under broiler and cook for about 6 minutes. Flip squash over using tongs or spatula, bake another 2 – 4 minutes, or until both sides are nicely browned. Once you flip be sure to keep an eye on them so they don’t burn and overcook. (This method may take 2 or 3 batches to complete depending on the size of your broiler)

Serve with sriracha. Feel free to use any condiment you like.
Serves 4

I recommend salting the water well to really bring out the flavor (I would not usually recommend this but if using 100% buckwheat noodles they will benefit from this…at least I think so). Once done, rinse the soba noodles under cool running water to cool them down and stop them from cooking, or they will turn mushy.
Cucumber: In the meantime, prepare your cucumber using a julienne tool. If your cucumber is really long, you can cut it in half before you julienne it if you like. You can also spiralize if you have a spiralizer. Feel free to cut them into 1/4 inch x 1 1/2 inch matchsticks pieces if you don’t have a julienne tool.
Combine: Once noodles are rinsed, return to the pot they cooked in, add the cucumber, cilantro and about 3/4 of the sauce, toss well. 
Serve: In a single serving dish, add 1/2 of the noodle mixture, top with 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and salt & pepper to taste. Add as much lime juice as you like. I especially loved the lime and used about 2 juicy ones for myself.
Serve warm or cold. 
Serves 3, or 2 generously.

Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water for water saute
5 cups leeks (about 2–3 large or 4–5 small), sliced
4 cups sweet potatoes (about 2 small), diced
3 cups zucchini (about 2 small), chopped
6 cups vegetable broth 
mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper, to taste
2 teaspoons turmeric or curry powder, optional

To serve

2 tablespoons basic cashew sour cream, optional
chopped fresh chives or scallions, for garnish


","

Instructions


Chop and prepare your vegetables. For the leeks, once sliced place them in a bowl of cool water swishing them around to rinse away any dirt that is trapped, drain in a colander giving another good rinse, or simply use a colander making sure to break up the rings releasing any dirt in between. The sweet potatoes can either be peeled or left unpeeled.
In a large dutch oven or stockpot, heat oil over medium, add leeks, and saute until softened, about five minutes. Add the sweet potatoes, zucchini, vegetable broth, salt, pepper, and optional turmeric, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Let cool for about 10 – 15 minutes. Using a handheld submersion blender, blend until creamy. Add the cream and blend again. Or you may opt to use a blender or food processor to blend your soup (this will most likely take two batches to complete).
Serve hot or chilled (I especially liked this warm or at room temp).
Makes about 4 servings

2 tablespoons tamari, coconut aminos or soy sauce
1 tablespoons liquid smoke, optional
1 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
2 cups large flaked coconut
mineral salt for sprinkling, optional
coconut oil for greasing, optional


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
Mix: In a large mixing bowl, combine the tamari, liquid smoke, maple syrup and paprika, making sure to break up any clumps. Add coconut flakes and gently toss making sure to coat each flake well, toss for about 45 seconds or so.
Layer: Using a slotted spoon, scoop seasoned coconut flakes and place onto a lightly greased, or parchment paper lined, rimmed baking sheet in a single layer. The key is to stir during baking to cook evenly. Sprinkle lightly with a bit of mineral salt if desired.
Bake: Place in oven and bake for 15 minutes. Set the timer for intervals of 5 minutes and stir each time making sure to rearrange all pieces by bringing the center flakes to the outside, and the outside flakes to the center for even cooking. If making a double batch and using two cookie sheets, you may even like to change the position of the sheets in the oven after the second interval, moving the top sheet to the bottom rack and vice versa. Remove when coconut has a nice browned and caramelized color.
If for some reason you need to bake longer than 15 minutes, keep close and watch as the coconut bacon can burn very quickly at this point. I really babied my coconut bacon towards the end, it’ll be worth your while if you do too so it doesn’t burn. 
Cool: Let cool, it will get crispy as it cools.
Store: Once completely cooled you can store leftovers in an airtight container and keep in the pantry for up 1 to 2 months. If it softens a bit, re-crisp in the toaster oven on medium for a few minutes, or under the broiler for a few seconds, keeping an eye that it doesn’t burn.

avocado, sliced or mashed
red onion, sliced
whole-grain or dijon mustard (hummus or vegan mayo is great too)
sriracha or Sriracha Cashew Cream (use the sriracha cream in place of mustard)
burger buns of choice


","

Instructions


If baking in the oven, turn oven to 375 degrees F. (It’s helpful to read instructions first before making the patties)
Quinoa: In a medium pot, add the quinoa, water, red bell pepper, corn, onion, garlic + onion powder, thyme, paprika, and salt. Give a gentle stir, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes.
Mash the beans: While the quinoa is cooking, drain and mash the white beans. You can quickly mash the beans in your colander if it has smaller-sized holes (it’ll save you a dish to wash). I mash about 3/4 of the beans, leaving a quarter of the batch whole or somewhat whole.
Add beans and flax meal: Once quinoa is done, remove the cover and stir in the mashed white beans and flax meal, mixing well. Let the mixture cool for 10 – 15 minutes. Taste for flavor – seasoning to taste with salt, pepper, and other spices.
Divide and make your patties: I like to pat my mixture into the bowl a little and divide it with a knife into 4 sections, making a plus sign if you will. Take each section and pack it tightly into a ball in the palm of your hands. Flatten with your palms and place on a hard surface. Cup the edges with your palm, tighten them in a bit, and squeeze together any cracks that have formed. Flatten the top to the desired size. Mine were about 1/2 inch thick with a 3 1/2 – 4 inch diameter.
Cook one of two ways:

Oven: In the oven at 375 degrees on a greased or parchment-lined cookie sheet for 30 minutes, turning once after 15 minutes. I also added a sprinkle of himalayan salt to the top before baking.
Stovetop: In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon coconut oil or olive oil over medium to medium-high heat. Cook patties for about 4 – 5 minutes on each side. Burgers should be lightly charred, crispy, and browned on the outside with a tender center.

I cooked both ways and had no preference. They both held up well and cooked great.
Makes 4 jumbo patties
Serve on a bun or bed of leafy greens with your favorite toppings!

Optional add-ins for variation:

Small jalapeno, seeds removed and diced (add a few seeds for extra heat)
Small green bell pepper, cored and diced
2 – 4 tablespoons unsulfured blackstrap molasses


","

Instructions


(These instructions are for the no-soak method, if using soaked beans, see notes below)
INSTANT POT (no soak method):

Press the SAUTE setting on your Instant Pot and add 1/4 cup water. When hot, add onion and saute for 4 minutes. Add the smoked paprika and garlic powder, cook for 1 minute, or until fragrant, stirring frequently.
Next add the beans, broth, tomato paste, maple syrup, apple cider vinegar, mustard, bay leaves, ground pepper and salt, gently stir until the tomato paste is dissolved completely and everything is well combined.
Attach the lid, and make sure the vent is in the SEALED position. Push the PRESSURE COOKER button, and manually set at HIGH for 75 minutes. When done, let the steam vent for 20 minutes. Move the vent to open, careful not to burn yourself as there may still be a little steam left. Remove lid and let cool a bit, add salt to taste. Remove bay leaves and taste for seasoning. Transfer beans to a serving dish.
Beans will thicken once cooled. If too thick, add 2 tablespoons of water at a time, mix well, and repeat until desired consistency.

Total cooking time with coming to pressure is about 2 hours and 5 minutes.
SLOW COOKER (no-soak method):

In bottom of slow cooker, add the onion, beans, maple syrup, vinegar, 4 cups water/broth, tomato paste, smoked paprika, garlic powder, mustard, pepper, and bay leaves. Gently stir, until the tomato paste has broken up and dissolved.
Cook on HIGH for 8 – 10 hours. Check periodically, adding up to 1/2 cup more water as needed (I’ve used up to 1 + 1/2 cups for 8 hours). You will also want to check for doneness towards the end so the beans don’t overcook. Add salt to taste.

Store: Keep leftovers in and airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. These freeze wonderfully, and will keep for up to 2 months in the freezer. Thaw before reheating.
Serves 6 – 8

3 medium apples, cored and chopped (peel if you prefer)
1 1/2 cups cranberries (fresh or frozen)
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon sugar (coconut or organic pure cane)
1 heaping teaspoon cinnamon

Topping

1 3/4 cup oats (quick, regular oats or a combo)
1/4 cup flaxseed meal or almond meal
1 cup finely chopped walnuts or pecans, optional
1/2 cup pure maple syrup (if making oil free add 2 tablespoons extra)
3 – 4 tablespoons coconut oil (at room temp), optional
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon mineral salt
cinnamon, to garnish


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Put the fruit together: Wash, slice, core and dice the apples, into about 3/4 inch pieces. Combine apples, cranberries, lemon juice, sugar and cinnamon. Mix well and layer into a 9 x 9 baking dish, you can also use an oval shaped dish.
Make the topping: In a mixing bowl (shown above), combine oats, flaxseed meal, walnuts/pecans, maple syrup, optional coconut oil (mine is oil-free), vanilla and salt, mix well. Spread oat mixture evenly over the apple and cranberries (shown below), and sprinkle with a little more cinnamon of you like.
Bake for 35 – 40 minutes, or until apples and cranberries are fork tender. Towards the end of cooking, about 20 – 25 minutes in, keep an eye on the topping, if its getting to dark, cover loosely with foil (nothing worse than a burnt crisp). Once done, let cool 5 – 10 minutes before serving.
Serve warm as is, with a scoop of non-diary vanilla ice cream or dollop of whipped coconut cream. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




2 medium potatoes (I used gold)
2 tsp olive oil
himalayan salt, to taste – go easy as they can get too salty


","

Instructions


Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Prep a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone mat.
Prep potatoes: Using a sharp knife, food processor attachment or mandolin, thinly slice the potatoes to about 1/16 of an inch. Pat the potatoes dry to remove excess moisture. Toss potatoes with oil and salt in medium size bowl (or you can go to the next step and lightly coat each side with oil while on the cookie sheet using a silicon brush – one less thing to wash this way, which was my way).
Roast: Place the potatoes in a single layer on the baking sheet, spread them out so they don’t tough each other. Place in the oven and bake for 10 minutes. Carefully remove from the oven, turn each chip and bake another 7 – 9 minutes, keep an eye on them towards the end so they don’t overcook. Remove any that seem ready or about to burn completely. Once baked, remove from oven and let cool for 2 – 5 min.

1 can (15 oz) chickpeas
1/2 cup cooked quinoa
1/4 cup coconut sugar (or organic brown sugar)
2 tablespoons salted natural peanut butter (smooth or chunky)
2 – 3 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce
1/4 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 cup scallions (green onions), thinly sliced
1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce
1/4 cup roasted salted peanuts, crushed or finely chopped

Peanut Sauce

1/2 lime, juiced
1/2 – 1 teaspoon garlic chili sauce
2 – 4 tablespoons hot water, to thin

Lettuce wraps

1 head butter or bibb lettuce or 1 – 2 head romaine
shredded carrots
sliced green onions
chopped peanuts
chopped fresh cilantro
lime wedges


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat, or lightly grease with oil.
Mash chickpeas: Drain, rinse and pat the chickpeas dry as possible. In a medium size mixing bowl, add chickpeas and mash well with the back of a fork (pulsing in a blender/food processor will also work).
Mix the meatball mixture: Add in the remaining ingredients for the meatballs with the mashed chickpeas. Mix well to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. If mixture is too wet, add a bit more crushed peanuts (a few tablespoons of breadcrumbs would work great too). I will depend on how wet your quinoa and peanut butter are.
Roll meatballs: Scoop up mixture, using about 1 – 1 1/2 heaping tablespoons. Gently, but firmly press the mixture together and shape into balls, rolling between your palms. Take your time. You should get about 12. The mixture my be sticky and you may need to rinse your hands after rolling 2 – 3 balls, it helps to keep your hands clean.
Bake: Place ‘meatballs’ on the prepared baking sheet. Place on the center rack in the oven for 25 – 20 minutes.
Peanut sauce: In a small bowl, mix the peanut butter, tamari, sugar, lime, garlic and chili sauce. Add hot water a tablespoon or so at a time until desired consistency. If too thin add more nut butter.
Serve: Place lettuce (you may want to double up the lettuce for added strength) on individual serving dishes, top with carrots, meatballs, scallions, peanuts, cilantro and a drizzle of peanut sauce. Enjoy to the fullest!
Serves 3 (4 meatballs per serving)
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 – 6 days.

3 medium leeks (use white and light green parts only)
2 1/2 lbs. potatoes, cubed 1/2 inch (peeled or with skin on)
1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme or Herbes de provence
1 bay leaf
4 cups water or low-sodium vegetable broth
mineral salt, to taste
1/4 cup chopped parsley, to garnish


","

Instructions


Prep: Leeks, start by removing and discarding the root ends and thick dark green parts. Cut the leeks in half lengthwise and rinse each half under cold water, pulling apart the layers to remove any sand or debris nestled inside, slice the leeks crosswise. Alternatively, slice the leeks, then put in a colander and wash well under running water. Should yield 4 – 5 cups. Cut potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes. Feel free to peel the potatoes or leave the skin on (I left the skin on).
Saute: In a large dutch oven or pot, heat the oil/water over medium heat. Add the leeks and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and wilted, about 10 minutes. Adjust the heat as necessary so as not to brown the leeks.
Simmer: Add the potatoes, broth, bay leaves, herbs, salt to the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer on low for 15 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender.
Puree: Remove the bay leaves, and puree the soup using a hand-held immersion blender until smooth (or leave a little chunky). Alternatively, use a regular blender to puree the soup in batches. Taste for seasoning. 
Serve: Serve warm with chopped parsley, crispy chickpea croutons, and a side of crusty artisan bread.

1/2 small red cabbage, thinly sliced
3 tablespoons apple cider or red wine vinegar
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped
pinch of mineral salt

Instructions


Press tofu: Drain tofu, place block on its side and cut in half lengthwise. With halves still together, place tofu flat and cut into thirds on its longest side. You will get six pieces. Place tofu between a double folded kitchen towel and add a heavy book or pot over top to remove excess moisture. Let sit while you prepare the marinade.
Marinate: In a small/medium size baking dish or pan (I used a loaf pan), mix together the lime juice, cumin and salt. Place tofu in mixture and marinate for at least 30 min, and up to 24 hours.
Cabbage slaw: In a medium size mixing bowl, add the cabbage, vinegar, cilantro and salt, mix well and give a toss every now and then. Let set at least 10 min. Making it ahead a day or two is also great!
Grill tofu: Heat grill over medium to medium-high heat. Add enough oil to generously coat the side of the griddle you’ll be using, about two tablespoons. Add a drop of water to the griddle, if it sizzles it’s ready. Place tofu on griddle, cook 3 – 4 minutes per side, or until you get nice grill marks. It helps to press the tofu with the back of a spatula to release excess liquids and aid in grill marks. Once done, set aside.
Serve: Warm tortillas over medium-low heat on a gas or electric burner. Layer each tortilla with on piece tofu, red cabbage slaw and chipotle sauce. Top with optional pico de gallo and a squeeze of lime.

Master Recipe:

3 cups lukewarm water
1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast
1 1/2 tablespoon coarse salt
6 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

I used this halved recipe for loaf shown:

1 1/2 cups lukewarm water
1 packet active dry yeast (about 2 1/4 teaspoons)
2 teaspoons himalayan salt
3 1/4 cups bread flour



","

Instructions


MAKE THE DOUGH:
Mix: In a very large mixing bowl combine the water, yeast and salt. If adding herbs, now is a good time, use a teaspoon or so of your favorite herbs or double if using fresh. Add flour all at once and stir with a wooden spoon. Takes only a minute, if that. No need to knead, just mix. You just want everything mixed well, no streaks of flour left, and you’re done.
Rise: Cover container loosely (I used a towel to cover). Let it rise in a warm area with no draft, may take anywhere from 2 to 4 hours depending on temperatures (ideal temp is 80 – 90).
Separate: Once done, if making the master recipe, pull away 1/4 of the dough and refrigerate the rest to bake later. Store unused dough covered tightly with plastic wrap in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
Shape: Lightly dust your hands and flat surface with flour, or cornmeal, so it won’t stick. Take your dough and place it on the floured flat surface, gently pull the sides of the dough toward the bottom, rotating the dough until you get a roundish shape with a smooth surface. Also, don’t worry if the bottom is a little bunched, it will flatten out upon the second rising.
Rest: Place your dough ball onto a flat surface lined with parchment paper (if not using parchment paper, place on flat surface dusted with cornmeal or flour), and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. No need to cover it. If the dough has been refrigerated, it helps to let it rest a little more, until it’s no longer chilled.
BAKE THE DOUGH:
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Placing a cast iron skillet, pizza stone, roasting pan or shallow fry pan in the oven to get it nice and hot (a baking sheet will be fine too). Let the oven preheat for 30 minutes.
Prep oven and dough: When ready to bake, place a rimmed cookie sheet or small pot with at least 1 cup of water on the bottom rack to steam – this will help the crust get nice and crispy, but it’s fine if you skip it. Line your baking vessel with parchment paper or lightly flour with cornmeal. Dust a little flour on top of your loaf, using a knife slash the top, about 1/4 inch deep, in a cross, tick tac toe or scallop pattern (this helps the bread expand when baking while also giving it a rustic look).
Bake: Place prepped dough in center of baking vessel and place in the oven, center rack, for 30 – 40 minutes, until you get a nice brown crust. Carefully remove from oven, let cool a few minutes and enjoy!

1 1/2 cups fresh cooked garbanzo beans (chickpeas) or 1 can (15oz) garbanzo beans
2 – 3 tablespoons sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
1/4 cup tahini (or cut in half and use 2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil)
1 clove garlic
1/2 teaspoon paprika (regular or smoked)
1/2 teaspoon mineral salt, or to taste
juice of 1 lemon or 1 – 2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 – 1/3 cup water, as needed


","

Instructions


Sun-Dried Tomato Hummus:
If using packaged sun-dried tomatoes, soak your tomatoes in water for about 15 minutes to soften, reserve water. If they are super fresh, no need to soak, just chop and use. Use the remaining water as needed when adding it to the hummus. If using bottled in oil sun-dried tomatoes, use as is.
Place all ingredients into food processor/blender, except for the water. Blend until creamy, about 3 minutes or so, adding water as needed to thin. I used about 1/3 cup water as I like my hummus on the moist, thin side.
Makes about 1 1/2 cups.
Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 – 6 days.
Assemble your wrap:
Lay your lavash bread on a flat surface. Spread a nice layer of hummus over 3/4, top with about 1/2 cup lentils over top, sprinkle with red pepper flakes and mineral salt, add leafy greens over top. Roll gently, but tightly as you can. Slice in half and enjoy!

3/4 teaspoon each dried tarragon & savory or 1 1/2 teaspoons herbes de provence or thyme
pinch of red pepper flakes
3 cups cooked or 2 cans (15 oz.) cannellini beans (drained and rinsed)
5 cups vegetable broth
mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper to taste
fresh parsley, to garnish

Instructions


In a large pot or dutch oven, heat oil/water over medium-high. Add leeks and saute until softened, about 5 minutes. Add in herbs and spices, cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add in potatoes, beans, broth and salt & pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until potatoes are fork tender. Let cool a few minutes before serving.
Serve topped with fresh chopped parsley. Great with your favorite crusty no knead bread or this easy gluten-free Socca Flatbread to soak up the juices!
Serves 4 – 6
NOTES:
You can change up the herbs here with what you have on hand. I really love the tarragon and savory here but starter cooks may not have them on hand so the herbs de provence and thyme will be great too!

1 1/2 cups raw cashews, soaked
1/2 cup water
juice of 1 large lemon or 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 – 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast, optional
1 small garlic clove
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
himalayan sea salt & cracked pepper, to taste


","

Instructions


Soak Cashews: First, it’s best to soak your cashews in water before starting. There are 2 ways to soak:

Soak cashew in cool water for at least 2 hours in a bowl of water, covering the cashews about 2 – 3 inches of water as they will swell up.
For a quick method of soaking, let cashews sit in hot water for 5 minutes.

Blend: Drain cashews and place all remaining ingredients into a blender or food processor, process until creamy stopping to scrape down the sides every few minutes. Taste for flavors adding any additional ingredients. Some like a salty ricotta so feel free to add as much salt as you want.
Chill: Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for an hour or two, this will stiffen the mixture a bit. You can also prepare your dish straight away without refrigeration if needed. Refrigeration will thicken the mixture a bit. If it becomes too thick, add a tad of water and mix well.
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a 5 – 6 days. To keep longer, store in the freezer for up to 2 months in a freezer safe container. Let thaw in the refrigerator. Give a good stir before using.

Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




1 – 8 peppers, any color

If making a large batch and storing in the freezer

parchment paper
air tight containers that are freezer safe

For storing in jars

vinegar (plain, balsamic, white/red wine, or apple cider)
mineral salt
olive oil
clean pint sized mason jars


","

Instructions


PREPPING PEPPERS:
There are two ways to prepare your peppers for roasting.

 The first is to simply roast the whole pepper, seeds, stem and all. (This will work with all roasting methods.)
 The second is to slice the peppers in half lengthwise, remove the stem and seeds, and place on the baking sheet cut side down. (Use this method for the oven method and/or when using a baking sheet. These peppers require no flipping, only rotating of the baking sheet. This is my favorite way of roasting peppers.)

ROASTING METHODS:
Oven: Preheat oven to 475 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or a Silpat. 
Place peppers on baking sheet. Bake 4 – 5 inches from the flame. If using an electric oven or there is no flame, place baking sheet on the middle rack. Roast peppers for 40 minutes, turning at least once during cooking using sturdy tongs (if peppers are sliced in half no need to turn, just rotate the baking sheet 180 degrees). They are ready when charred/blackened and blistered. Whole peppers will still be full of air and puffy once removed from the oven. As the peppers cool they will deflate and become wrinkly looking.
Broiler: I used to have an oven where the broiler was underneath the oven, now mine is in the oven. Either way, turn broiler to medium – high (or 500 degrees if yours is by numbers) and char peppers turning every so often until browned and blackened. If you’ve prepped your peppers by slicing in half, no need turn the peppers, simply adjust the baking sheet turning it to get all the peppers charred. This may take anywhere from 15 – 25 minutes.
Open Grill: Place whole peppers on their sides over an open flame on the grill, turning every now and then until nicely charred all over. Depending on how big your grill is will determine how many you can do at one time.
Stove Top: If roasting just 1 or 2 peppers, you can roast it over the gas burner of your stove (I suppose you could do 4 peppers utilizing each burner). Place pepper on its side and adjust the flame so it ‘licks’ the peppers. Keep an eye on it and turn it as needed to blacken and char, about 15 – 20. This tends to be a more time consuming method since you have to be so watchful.
STEAMING & PEELING:
While peppers are hot from the oven, carefully place them in a bowl and cover with a plate, or use a pot with lid. The goal is to steam the peppers making the skin peel easily. Let the peppers steam for about 30 minutes. Once peppers are cool, remove the skins, stems and seeds. I find it easiest to peel the pepper from the bottom to the top. A few seeds left are fine. Do not run peppers under water to clean, you’ll lose most of the roasted flavor that you worked so hard get. Keep as much of the pepper juices as you can if storing leftovers.
From here you can use right away to make hummus, romesco, soups, layer on sandwiches and toss in salads, etc.
STORING:
Rerfrigerator: Great for short term storage.

Keep leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a 5 – 6 days. 
If you coat them with a little oil they will for a couple of weeks. You can even add some of the pepper juices to the container. 
To always be safe, at the first sign of mold or spoilage, throw away immediately.

If storing for longer, you have a couple simple options:
Freezing: This is my favorite method of long term storing, as it is not blended with any other flavors, it’s super easy to do, and they thaw out amazingly well.

Freeze your peppers in a tightly sealed container. They thaw out pretty fast once removed from the freezer making this a nice way of preserving your precious peppers. 
This method of storing is a neutral way of keeping the full roasted flavor intact as they won’t be tainted with any other flavors. 
I would suggest cutting and placing a small piece of parchment paper between the peppers for easy removal. 
Will last up to 2 months. 

Vinegar Method: This is method will leave your peppers with a little bit of tang from the vinegar, in some cases it may overpower them, but it’s a great way to store them. Use these peppers for sauces, dips, and soups.

Place peppers in a jar with a little salt, vinegar and pepper juices. 
To do this you’ll want to sprinkle your peppers with a generous pinch of mineral salt and mix well. 
Place 1/2 inch of vinegar at the bottom of your pint sized mason jar, add peppers leaving about 1 1/2 inches headspace. 
Using the handle of a spoon or fork, poke along the inside edges of the jar to release air bubbles (this is important), pour reserved pepper juices over top so peppers are completely covered, leaving 3/4 inch room. 
Add about 1/8 inch of olive oil over top to keep air out, leaving 1/2 inch headspace. 
Seal and place towards the back of the refrigerator. Will be good for up to 2 months, maybe even a little longer. 
If you see any sign of mold or spoilage, throw away immediately!

","

Instructions


Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Prep: If you’re using canned chickpeas, place them in a colander and rinse them under cool running water.
Dry: Fold a large dish towel or flour sack in half, placing the chickpeas between. With your hands laid flat, roll the chickpeas using the palm of your hand and extended fingers to move the garbanzo beans around. Try to remove as much of the moisture as you can.
Remove loose skins: Once dried, pick away any skins that have noticeably become detached or loosened by gently pinching the chickpeas between your thumb and forefinger. Repeat rolling the chickpeas one more time for good measure.
Oil & Season: Spread the chickpeas onto a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silpat (affiliate links), lightly greased is ok too. Drizzle with a teaspoon or two of olive oil, add seasoning and mix well to coat. Arrange the chickpeas across the baking sheet in a single layer.
Roast: Bake for 40 – 45 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so. Once done let cool a bit before using or storing.
Store: Chickpeas will stay crispy and crunchy stored in an uncovered or loosely covered bowl or container. When stored in an airtight container they will soften up and lose their crunchy texture. Will last on the counter for 5 days or so.

Instructions


Roast poblanos: Turn broiler to medium – high, place poblanos on baking sheet and place under the broiler for about 7 – 10 minutes, turning every few minutes to char and brown evenly on all sides. Poblanos will crackle and pop while cooking, they will be ready when charred and softened to the touch of a fork pushing on its side. Place poblanos in a bowl, cover with a plate or saran wrap and let steam for a few minutes (this will help loosen the skin for peeling). Remove the skin, lay the peeled poblano on a flat surface, remove the top and make a slit down the center, open and remove the seeds. Slice lengthwise into 1/2 inch strips.
Heat beans: Place beans in a small pot and cook over medium until warm, stirring occasionally. If using pinto or black beans, add a dash or two of garlic powder for a little extra flavor. You may decide to not heat your canned whole beans in which case, drain and rinse before using.
Prep veggies: Prepare scallions, purple cabbage and avocado. Heat your tortillas over the gas/electric burner until slightly charred.

3 lbs. apples, about 6 – 7 (fuji, gala, granny smith, honey crisp, delicious)
1 small lemon, juice of
1/2 cup water
1 cinnamon stick or 1/2 – 1 teaspoon cinnamon, optional


","

Instructions


Prepare the apples:

Unpeeled: Wash the apples well, quarter and core the apples, cut the quarters in half.
Peeled: Peel the apples, quarter, core and cut the quarters in half.

INSTANT POT:

Place apples in the bottom of the Instant pot, add the lemon juice, water and optional cinnamon.
Attach lid, and make sure vent is in the SEALED position. Push the PRESSURE COOKER button, and manually set the time for 6 minutes.
When done, let the steam vent on it’s own, takes about 6 minutes. Move the vent to open, careful not to burn yourself as there may still be steam left. Remove lid and let cool a bit, remove cinnamon stick.
Mash or puree: If cooking with the skins on, use an immersion blender right in the pot to puree the mixture, or transfer to a blender or food processor to puree until desired consistency. When cooking without the skins you can simply mash with a potato masher or back of a fork or slotted spoon.

SLOW COOKER:

Add the apples to the bottom of the crockpot, add the lemon, water and optional cinnamon, and cover with lid.
Set the slow cooker on high for 4 hours, stirring once or twice. Let cool a few minutes, remove cinnamon stick, and mash or puree.
Mash or puree: If cooking with the skins on, use an immersion blender right in the pot to puree the mixture, or transfer to a blender or food processor to puree until desired consistency. When cooking without the skins you can simply mash with a potato masher or back of a fork or slotted spoon.

Store your applesauce in the refrigerator for up to 7 days, or freeze for up to 2 months.
Makes 4 – 4 1/2 cups.
NOTES:
For ultra smooth applesauce, use a blender to puree.
If you prefer more sweetness, add a tad of sugar 1 – 2 teaspoons at a time until desired sweetness.
If you didn’t add cinnamon while cooking, feel free to add some after cooking.
Picking apples:
When picking your apples stick with your favorites to start, using all of one type or a combination of 2 – 3 types of apples. Organic is best, especially if cooking with the skins on!
I’ve used all fuji apples which were delicious and on the sweeter side. So if you prefer your applesauce to be very sweet use only fuji.
As for combinations, my favorites are a mix of fuji and granny smith apples or a mix of honey crisp, granny smith and fuji. These combos balance each other out well, having just the right amount of natural sweetness and tartness.
To peel or not to peel your apples?

Peeling: It takes a bit longer to prep but the end result is a little easier since you’ll simply need to mash the apples with a potato masher, back of a fork or back of a slotted spoon.
No Peel: The prep time moves along quicker, but the end time may take a little longer with the need to use an immersion blender, or transferring the cooked apples to a blender or food processor, to get a smooth consistency. The clear advantage of not peeling your apples is the health benefits, apples skins have antioxidants and fiber.

1/2 teaspoon mineral salt
3/4 cup warm water (between 105 and 115ºF.)
4 tablespoons unsweetened non-dairy yogurt, at room temp
2 teaspoons olive oil

garnish

melted vegan butter or garlic infused olive oil
freshly chopped parsley or cilantro


","

Instructions


Mix dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, add the flour, yeast, sugar and salt, mix to combine.
Mix wet ingredients: In a medium bowl or 2 cup measuring cup, combine the 3/4 cup warm water (between 105 and 115ºF.) with the yogurt and oil.
Combine dry & wet: Pour wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Mix the wet and dry ingredients together. Dough will be rough & shaggy looking and tacky to the touch.
Quick knead: Knead the dough by pulling the dough ball onto itself about 5 times, and form a ball. Doesn’t have to be a tight ball.
Cover and let rise: Tightly cover bowl with saran wrap and let rest in a warm area away from drafts for about 60 – 90 minutes. The warmer the area, the faster the dough will rise. Once dough has risen it will have doubled in size.
Turn dough out: Fill a small bowl with flour and lightly sprinkle a flat surface with flour. Turn dough onto the flat surface and sprinkle with flour. Dough will be tacky.
Shape dough: Dust fingers with flour and shape the dough into a rectangle, it doesn’t have to be a perfect shape.
Cut dough: Cut the dough into 6 pieces, making them as even as possible (again it doesn’t have to be perfect).
Roll & flatten: When ready to bake, roll a piece into a ball. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough into an oval shape (about 9 x 4 inches), flatting to about 1/8 inch thick. Add more flour as needed to your work area and fingers.
Heat skillet and bake: Get the skillet nice and hot by heating over medium-high heat. Place dough onto the skillet surface. When bubbles start to appear (above left), flip the naan and cook the other side.
Garnish: Once done brush with olive oil or melted vegan butter and enjoy!
Makes 6
Store: Leftover naan can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days on the counter. To keep longer, freeze for up to 2 months.

Scale
1x2x3x 




1 1b. pizza dough (I used Trader Joe’s), divided into 4 sections
1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water
1/2 onion, sliced or diced
2 – 3 garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoons dried thyme
3 large portobello mushrooms (about 6oz.), sliced
1 1/2 cups broccoli florets, cut somewhat small
4 – 6 large leaves of kale (curly or flat), stems removed and roughly chopped or left somewhat whole
large handful cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced in half
himalayan salt and pepper, to taste
cornmeal for dusting the pizza wheel

Garlic Cream Sauce

1 cup raw cashews, soaked (see notes)
1/2 cup water, plus a little more as needed
2 – 3 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons white miso
juice of 1 lemon
himalayan salt & pepper, to taste


","

Instructions


Prep dough: Remove pizza dough, slice into 4 equal pieces, sprinkle with a little flour, lay a towel overtop and let pizza dough come to room temp away from oven heat for 30 minutes.
Garlic-miso cream: Drain cashews and place all ingredients for the cream into a small blender cup and process until creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. If cream is too thick and extra water 1 tablespoon at a time until desired consistency, being careful not to thin it out too much making it runny, if in doubt leave it on the thick side. Taste for seasoning, set aside.
Saute veggies: In large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, garlic and cook until onions become soft. Add in mushrooms, broccoli, kale, thyme and salt & pepper to taste, cook for another 5 minutes or so. Turn off heat and cover ajar to help steam and soften the veggies a little more while working on the next step.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place pizza stone or cast iron pizza pan in the oven to heat up.
Make calzone: On a lightly floured surface or parchment paper, roll each portion out into an eight inch oval, rectangle, circle – whatever works easiest for you. Lay on some of the veggie mixture, add a few heaping tablespoons of the garlic miso cream and top with tomatoes. Fold the other half over and seal the edges by pressing with a fork. Make a few small slits in the top so steam is able to release. Top with a light coat of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt, pepper and thyme.
Bake: Dust the heated pizza stone with cornmeal, place calzone on the pizza stone (or if using parchment paper, transfer to pan or stone) and bake for 15 – 20 minutes, until crust is puffy and golden brown. Let cool a few minutes before serving.
Serve with garlic miso sauce on the side.
Store: Calzones can be kept in a covered container in the refrigerator for up 4 days. Reheat in a toaster oven or microwave.

optional ingredients

generous pinch of salt, or to taste
1 1/2 – 2 tablespoons oil (sesame, light olive oil, avocado, canola, etc.) *see notes
1/2 – 1 teaspoon garlic powder


","

Instructions


First, you may want to toast your seeds to bring out the most flavor, but this is optional. You want your seeds to become fragrant and slightly darker during the process. 
Toast your seeds one of two ways:

 Preheat oven to 350. Place seeds on a roasting pan or rimmed cookie sheet and roast for about 10 – 15 minutes making sure to move them around every few minutes so the seeds on the bottom don’t burn.

OR

 Dry roast over medium-low heat in a skillet using one cup at a time (add more or less depending on your skillet). Be sure to move the seeds around frequently to ensure that they don’t burn.

Process the sesame seeds: Once you have toasted your seeds and they have cooled a bit, place them in your food processor or high-speed blender (add optional salt/garlic powder), and process until creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides a few times. The process will take approximately 5 – 10 minutes to blend depending on your equipment.
Makes about 1 1/2 cups.
Store: Keep in the pantry for 1 month (maybe more), in an airtight container. For maximum freshness, store it in the fridge for up to 6 months.

1/2 cup hemp hearts
6 medjool dates, pitted and chopped
3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, optional
pinch of salt, optional


","

Instructions


Mix: Place all ingredients in food processor, blend until combined. Add 1 tablespoon water at time if needed to help the mixture clump up. I used about 1 tablespoon, use at your discretion. 
Don’t worry if the dough seems a little too sticky, as it will become a bit stiffer once refrigerated. And if it’s a little sticky it will help when you roll the balls in a coating. If the mixture is too wet, try adding a pinch or two of oats. The dryer they are the more they will be a stiffer, but chewy cookie. The moister they are, they will be more like cookie dough. Both ways are good. :)
Scoop + roll: Next, roll the dough into one inch balls. If dough seems too sticky to roll, refrigerate the dough for about 20 minutes before rolling. 
Finishing touch: You can roll the energy bites in a variety of ingredients for a nice finishing touch. I rolled some in hemp seeds, coconut, cinnamon and cacao powder. I wanted to experiment with different coatings. If rolling in powders be sure to gently lift and drop your coated balls a few times an inch or two above a hard surface to let any excess powder fall off.
Makes 12 energy bites

mineral salt & cracked pepper to taste


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.
Let dough rest: Coat an 8 or 10 inch cast iron skillet with olive oil. Remove dough from refrigerator, open package and place dough in center of the skillet, cover skillet with a clean dish towel. Let set for 30 minutes.
Roast veggies: Prep the mushrooms, zucchini, bell pepper and onion. Place on a rimmed baking sheet, along with the tomatoes for the sauce, drizzle with olive oil and gently toss to coat, keeping the tomatoes together. Sprinkle with salt. Place in the oven on the middle rack for 15 minutes. Remove and set aside.
Pre-bake dough: Remove dish towel for skillet and gently flatten out dough, pushing up the edges about 1 – 1/2 inches. Place in oven on middle rack and bake for 10 minutes.
Make sauce: While dough is pre-cooking, add the warm tomatoes, and remaining ingredients for the balsamic tomato sauce to a food processor or blender and process until blended and fairly smooth. Taste for flavor adding anything extra you might like.
Bake pizza: Remove dough from the oven, layer with 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce and reserved roasted vegetables. Place in oven and bake for 15 minutes, until crust is golden. Remove from oven and let cool a few minutes before cutting to serve.
Serve with red pepper flakes and a good dusting of almond parmesan.
NOTES:
If your crust doesn’t become golden enough for you, place the skillet pizza under the broiler for a minute or so checking often so it doesn’t burn.
I would love to recommend a good pizza dough recipe but I haven’t made one yet and find the ready made dough is quick and works great for me. If you have a good whole wheat pizza dough recipe I’d love know about it!

3 heads romaine lettuce, chopped
1 avocado, sliced (optional)
Almond Parmesan

Chickpea Croutons

1 can (15oz) chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed
1 tablespoon olive oil
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
generous pinch mineral salt

Caesar Dressing

3/4 cup raw cashews
1/2 cup water
2 garlic cloves
2 teaspoons capers
1 tablespoon vegan worcestershire (I use Annie’s)
2 teaspoons dijon mustard
juice of 1 medium lemon or 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
generous pinch of mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat.
Chickpea Croutons: Place rinsed chickpeas between a clean dish cloth, and gently rub them to dry, removing any of the loose skins. Place chickpeas on a prepared baking sheet, drizzle with oil and toss to coat, sprinkle with garlic powder and salt. Arrange chickpeas in a single layer, and garlic cloves (from the dressing), and bake for 40 – 45 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so. Remove the garlic if they seem to be getting too baked (especially if they are on the smaller side). Once done, set aside.
Caesar Salad Dressing: Soak the cashew in hot water (not boiling) for 5 minutes, drain. In a high speed or personal blender, add the cashews, water, roasted garlic cloves, capers, worcestershire, dijon, lemon juice, salt & pepper, blend until creamy smooth. Makes about 1 cup.
Assemble Caesar Salad: Place the chopped romaine in a large mixing bowl, add as much or as little of the dressing as you like, you may have some leftover, and give a good toss. Top with chickpea croutons, avocado, and a sprinkle of Almond Parmesan.
Serves 3 – 4
Store: Leftover salad and dressing will stay fresh in the refrigerator for up to 5 – 6 days in covered containers.

Instructions


Black Beans: In a medium pot, warm oil over medium heat, add the onions and saute for 5 minutes. Add the jalapeno, cumin, oregano, garlic powder and pinch of salt, cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until nice and fragrant. Add the beans, and 1/4 cup of water, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 – 8 minutes. Remove from heat, smash at least 1/2 of the beans, using the back of a slotted spoon or fork. Add the remaining water as needed for desired consistency. If you add too much water, the beans will thicken upon standing. Taste for flavor adding more salt as needed.
Warm the tortillas: I love to warm my tortillas over a medium-low flame of the stovetop burner, flipping them often until they are lightly charred around the edges.
Assemble: Lay the tortilla on a flat surface, top with 1/4 cup of the beans, small handful of leafy greens, pico de gallo and/or corn salsa, sliced avocado, and crumbled cheese (optional). Add a sprinkle of salt and squeeze of lime overtop.
Makes about 10 tacos, 2 tacos per serving.
Store in the refrigerator or freezer: Keep leftover black beans in the refrigerator 4 – 5 days, stored in covered containers. For longer storage, keep in the freezer for 2 – 3 months in freezer safe containers. Let thaw before reheating.
To Reheat: Warm the beans on the stove over low, stirring occasionally, until warmed through. Alternately, place them in the microwave for 30 second intervals, stirring each time, until warmed.
NOTES:
These Instant Pot Black Beans made from scratch using dried beans would be great too!
For creaminess, try adding a dollop of Vegan Sour Cream or Sriracha Cashew Cream.

Notes:
Add in any vegetables you prefer….broccoli florets, sliced zucchini, radishes, bell peppers, artichokes hearts, olives, etc. In the cooler months try adding in roasted vegetables like sweet potato, butternut squash, broccoli, carrots, etc. You can also add in some fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro if you have them on hand.
Sub in sunflower seeds and/or sesame seeds for the pumpkin seeds and hemp hearts.
For the best chickpea flavor, try making them fresh at home. It’s really easy and nothing beats the freshness of homemade chickpeas!

Vegan sausage: If using plant-based sausage, you’ll want to cook it first. Slice it into bite-size pieces and cook in a skillet with 1 tablespoon oil, over medium heat until browned, about 3 – 5 minutes on each side. Transfer to a small plate lined with a paper napkin to soak up excess oil. 
Saute: In a large pan, heat oil/water over medium-high heat, add the onion, garlic, celery, and bell peppers, saute for 5 minutes. Add the smoked paprika, thyme, and oregano, and saute for 1 minute more.
Simmer: Add the crushed tomatoes, rice, bay leaves, and broth, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover askew, and simmer on low for 20 – 25 minutes, stirring every 7 minutes or so to keep the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan. In the last 5 minutes, add the beans and/or sausage and continue to cook until warmed through. Remove bay leaves, season with salt and pepper.

3 – 4 lbs apples (pref. a sweet variety, fuji, honey crisp, macintosh, gala, delicious), about 6 – 8 large, peeled, cored, and chopped (see notes)
2 cups fresh or frozen cranberries
1/2 cup water or apple/orange juice (or any combo)
1 lemon, juice of
1 large cinnamon stick or 1 teaspoon cinnamon

Optional tasty add-ins:

1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger or ginger powder
use apple cider vinegar in place of, or in combo with the water/juice


","

Instructions


INSTANT POT:

Place the quartered apples, than cranberries, lemon juice, apple/orange juice or water, and cinnamon stick in the insert of a 6 qt. Instant pot.
Attach lid, and make sure vent is in the SEALED position. Push the PRESSURE COOKER button, and manually set the time for 5 minutes.
When done, let the steam vent on it’s own, takes about 6 minutes. Move the vent to open, careful not to burn yourself as there may still be steam left. Remove lid and let cool a bit.
Remove the cinnamon stick and mash with a potato masher or back of a slotted spoon, until desired consistency. Alternately, for a smooth applesauce, once cooled a bit, use an immersion blender or transfer to a high-speed blender or food processor.

STOVETOP:

In a large pot, add the chopped apples, cranberries, lemon juice, apple/orange juice or water, and cinnamon stick, cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, for 15 – 20 minutes, or until the apples are very soft and/or berries pop.
Remove the cinnamon stick and mash with a potato masher or back of a slotted spoon, until desired consistency. Alternately, for a smooth applesauce, once cooled a bit, use an immersion blender/high-speed blender or food processor.

SLOW COOKER:

Add the diced apples to the bottom of the crockpot, add the cranberries, lemon juice, apple/orange juice or water and cinnamon stick.
Set the slow cooker on high for 4 hours, stirring once or twice.
Remove the cinnamon stick and mash with a potato masher or back of a slotted spoon, until desired consistency. Alternately, for a smooth applesauce, once cooled a bit, use an immersion blender/high-speed blender or food processor.

Serve warm or chilled.
Store your applesauce in the refrigerator for up to 7 days, or freeze in a freezer safe container for up to 2 months.
Makes 4 – 4 1/2 cups.
NOTES:
If applesauce is not sweet enough after cooking, add 1 tablespoon of pure maple syrup at a time, until desired sweetness.
Cut the apples accordingly:
Instant Pot: Quartered is fine, you don’t really need to worry about the size since the pressure cooker will cook them well, no matter what size they are.
Stovetop: Best to chop or dice, the smaller the cubes, the quicker they cook.
Crock pot: Chop or quartered will do fine, since they will be cooking for up to 4 hours.

Filling: In a large pan or pot, heat oil/water over medium heat, add onion and saute for 4 minutes, add bell pepper and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, zucchini and corn, cook another 3 minutes or so (cook veggies until they are as soft as you like, I prefer mine to be a little al dente). Add the black beans, quinoa, cilantro, cumin, chipotle, garlic & onion powder, and salt, continue to cook until heated through.
Roll: Place tortillas on a flat surface, place a mound of the filling in the center, leaving room all the way around, fold in half, fold up each end, and roll the burrito away from you to completely close it.
Freeze: I try to avoid foil, so here I used paper sandwich bags. Feel free to use foil, freezer paper, saran wrap, plastic freezer ziploc bags or whatever you’re used to freezing with. If using the paper sandwich bags, they should be eaten within a few weeks to avoid freezer burn. Most likely they won’t be around that long!
Reheat: If at room temperature, warm in the oven/toaster oven at 375 degrees F for 10 minutes or so, or microwave for 30 seconds. If frozen heat in the oven at 375 degrees for 30 minutes, or microwave for 1:30 – 2 minutes.
Serve with sliced avocado and your favorite salsa (I paired mine with a hatch chili salsa). You may also like to pair it with any of these condiments: Cashew Sour Cream, Cilantro-Lime Cashew Cream, Chipotle Tahini Dressing, Cumin-Lime Tahini Dressing, Pico de Gallo, or Homemade Guacamole.

Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




1 cup raw cashews, soaked for 2 – 3 hours
2 hatch chiles (Anaheim or poblano ok too, or 40z can of diced green chile peppers)
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1/2 teaspoon cumin
good pinch of salt
juice of 1 lime
1/2 – 3/4 cup water
1/4 cup cilantro, chopped


","

Instructions


Soak cashews: Soak your cashews in enough water to cover and have about 2 -3 inches of water over top. Cashews will swell up and need plenty of water to soak up. Let soak for 2 – 3 hours. Alternately, do a quick soak by soaking cashews in hot water for 5 minutes.
Broil chiles: Turn your broiler on to medium or medium-high, place the hatch chiles on a baking sheet and set under the broiler. Times will vary depending on your oven so pay attention and check on them every few minutes. You will hear them blister and crackle every now and then. Turn every few minutes to char evenly on all sides. Chiles will be ready when charred and softened. Mine took about 7 – 10 minutes. Let cool a few minutes.
Peel + slice: Remove the charred skin, make a slit lengthwise, core and remove the seeds (some seeds ok).
Puree: Place the cashews, chiles, cumin, garlic, cilantro, salt, lime juice and water (starting with the least amount) in a blender/food processor. Blend until creamy scraping down the sides every now and then. Taste for flavor and add more water as needed to create desired consistency.
Makes about 2 cups.
Serves 8, 1/4 cup per serving.
Store: Leftover dressing can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 6 – days. Dressing will thicken upon chilling, thin with water if needed.

Simmer: Add the sweet potatoes, lentils, broth and milk, bring to a gentle boil, cover and reduce heat to low and let simmer for 20 minutes, sweet potatoes should be fork-tender and lentils soft.
Puree: Once done, let cool a few minutes and blend until smooth using an immersion blender. Stir in the lime juice (start with 1/2 lime), check for flavor, adding the remaining 1/2 lime juice, salt & pepper to taste.  Add a tad more milk/water if you prefer a thinner soup.

Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




1 pumpkin
olive oil, grapeseed or coconut oil
mineral salt


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Cut and scoop: If using a sugar pumpkin, cut in half, scoop seeds out using a good-sized spoon and discard any orange flesh. If using a large carving pumpkin, cut a circle about 2 – 3 inches away from and around the stem, remove top and scoop out.
Rinse and dry: Place seeds in a colander and rinse well removing any small pieces of pumpkin. Dry excess water from pumpkin seeds using a dish towel or laying the seeds between a few sheets of paper towels.
Season: Place seeds on rimmed baking sheet, add a small glug of olive oil and toss the pumpkin seeds until well coated. Spread evenly in a single layer on the baking sheet and sprinkle with salt and any other desired spices or herbs. 
Roast: Place in oven on the middle rack and bake for 20 – 30 minutes, depending on your oven,  shuffling the seeds every 7 minutes or so. After 20 minutes, keep a close eye on them, as they can burn fast if cooked too long. You may hear some crackling and popping, this is normal. I would tend to suggest going the extra time as long as seeds are not burnt, especially for larger seeds. 
Once done, let cool for 10 minutes and enjoy!

pinch of mineral salt
1 1/4 cups unsweetened almond milk
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 tablespoon coconut oil (divided), for greasing
1 apple (optional)


","

Instructions


Preheat: Heat griddle as per instructions or if using a large skillet heat over medium to medium-high heat. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 200 degrees F, and place a baking sheet on the middle rack while oven is heating.
Prepare: In a large mixing bowl, add flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt, mix well. Next, add in the applesauce, non-dairy milk and vanilla extract, mix until just combined, do not over mix. Your mixture may seem to swell up a bit due to the baking powder, this is normal.

Place 2 apple slices on griddle, side by side, where pancake batter is going to cook. Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, scoop batter and place on top of apple slices. Cook until bubbles form on the top and edges start to look leathery, about 2 1/2 – 3 minutes per side. Flip pancakes, cook another 2 – 3 minutes. Repeat until batter is gone.
Keep Warm: As pancakes finish, place them in the oven on the warm cookie sheet to keep warm until all pancakes are ready.

3/4 cup water
1/2 cup pure maple syrup (or 1/3 cup cane sugar or coconut sugar)
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger or 1 teaspoon freshly grated
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder or 1 garlic clove, minced
2 T. cornstarch or 3 T. tapioca flour + equal amount of water


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Prep tofu-tempeh: Drain tofu and place between a clean folded dish towel, place a medium pot on top for about 10 minutes to remove excess water. If using super firm tofu, skip this step. Once done, cube into 3/4 – 1 inch cubes. Cube the tempeh as well.
Make teriyaki sauce: In a small saucepan, add the tamari, water, maple syrup/sugar, ginger and garlic, bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook on low for 1 minutes. In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch/tapioca powder with the water until smooth. Add the mixture to the teriyaki sauce and cook another minute, or until sauce thickens. Remove from heat, cover and set aside. Taste for flavor. If you like your teriyaki sauce on the sweeter side, add an extra tablespoon or two of your preferred sweetener.
Bake tofu-tempeh: In a 9×13 casserole or baking dish, add tofu and tempeh, drizzle with 1 cup of teriyaki sauce and gently toss to coat. Place in oven on middle rack and bake for 20 – 25 minutes. Turn down oven to 350 degrees F.
Cook rice: Cook rice according to package directions. I used basmati rice here which only took 20 minutes total to cook. Rice may vary in cooking time, some take as long as 40 minutes. If making a longer cooking rice you may like to start it earlier.
Steam veggies: Steam the veggies using a bamboo steamer, microwave or whatever is your preferred method.
Combine everything: In dish the tofu-tempeh cooked in, scoot the tofu and tempeh to one side, add the cooked rice and steamed vegetables. Pour most of the remaining teriyaki sauce overtop, reserving a little for serving, toss to combine. Enjoy as is or continue to next step to warm through if needed.
Bake: Place in preheated oven set to 350 degrees, uncovered, for about 10 – 15 minutes to heat through as needed (feel free to skip this step).
Serve: Place in individual bowls and top with a little remaining sauce. Would also be great with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds over top. Enjoy!

2 vegan sausages, sliced
5 large lacinato kale leaves, stems removed and julienned
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme or 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped
4 large zucchini, spiralized or julienned
mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper to taste


","

Instructions


In a medium size bowl, combine the milk and pumpkin puree, set aside.
In a large pan, heat oil over medium, add shallot and saute for 4 minutes, add garlic, sausage, kale and thyme, cook until kale softens, stirring occasionally, about 3 – 4 minutes. 
Turn heat to medium-low, add the pumpkin mixture, and give a good stir. Add in the zucchini noodles, using tongs, mix to coat, place the cover askew and let simmer 4 – 5 minutes, or until zucchini has become al dente, stirring occasionally. If the sauce is bubbling too much, reduce heat to low. Taste for flavor adding salt & pepper to taste.
Pairs great with a dusting of almond parmesan and slice of your favorite artisan bread.
Serves 3 – 4
NOTES:
Try using mushrooms in place of the sausage if you like. Simply add the mushroom with the shallots and cook until mushrooms have just started to sweat down. Continue with the kale and thyme, and so on…
Spiralized sweet potato would be great here too!
Use your favorite pasta. There’s enough sauce for about 12 – 16 oz. of pasta. Cook the pasta according to package directions and add it in the recipe in place of the zucchini. Easy peasy!
If you have garlic and powder on hand, try adding a dash or two. It will ensure full flavor.
RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT: For spiralizing zucchini noodles I love use this spiralizer , and for straight noodles use a hand held julienne tool. For more of my favorite cooking tools, shop my kitchen essentials.

Instructions


Cauliflower Rice: If using a head of cauliflower, grate cauliflower using a handheld grater or the grater on your food processor. Alternately, place cauliflower in a food processor and pulse until it resembles rice. (If using prepackaged cauliflower rice or pearls, skip this step.)
Heat 3 tablespoons water in a pan over medium-high, add cauliflower bits and saute, stirring constantly, for about 4 – 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add rice vinegar and mix well. Set aside, let cool completely.
Assemble: Fill a little bowl with water and keep handy. Place a nori sheet, shiny side down, on the bamboo mat. On the edge closest to you, layer and press the cauliflower rice on 2/3 of the sheet.
Add the mango, avocado, cucumber and red cabbage lengthwise, leaving about 1 inch on the end.
Start rolling the nori, folding over the mango, avocado, cucumber and cabbage, give a good press to secure, and continue to roll. Using the water, wet your finger and dab the top end of the nori with water to seal. Let rest a few minutes before cutting, nori will soften and the seal will dry. Repeat, until ingredients are gone.

Add broth and fettuccine, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to a semi-rigorous rolling boil and cook, stirring occasionally for about 13 – 14 minutes (if using different pasta, cooking times with vary so check the package directions for cooking times). About 4 minutes before pasta is done, add the peas and continue to cook. A little broth left at the end of cooking is ok (about 1/4 cup), it will add to the creaminess when the cream is added.

1 teaspoon vanilla extract
dash of himalayan salt
1/3 cup goji berries

Instructions


Melt cacao: Place the raw cacao butter in a small saucepan and heat on the lowest setting.

Alternatively, melt in the microwave using 30 second intervals, stirring after each until melted.
Blend: Combine the cashews, dates, vanilla bean seeds, vanilla extract and salt into your food processor/blender and blend until completely combined and you have a smooth consistency. With equipment turned off, slowly add the melted cacao butter and blend again until combined. 
Add berries: Transfer truffle mixture into a small bowl, mix in the goji berries. 
Chill and roll: Place mixture in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Scoop out rounded tablespoons of dough and roll into balls with the palms of your hand, washing hands as needed in between balls. Roll in shaved cacao butter or shredded coconut.

3/4 cup or 1/2 pint cherry/grape tomatoes
1 large carrot, peeled and diced
olive oil
1/2 –1 teaspoon cumin
salt + cracked pepper
1 can black beans, drained and rinsed
9 – 12 corn tortillas


","

Instructions


Cashew cream: Soak the cashews in two cups cold water for 2+ hours or hot water for 5 minutes, drain well. Place cashews, lime juice, paprika, onion powder, salt and 1/2 cup water into blender/nutribullet and blend until smooth. Add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to thin to desired consistency. Taste for flavor. Add more paprika to your liking, but keep in mind the color will change.
Enchilada sauce: Place the tomatillos, onion, garlic, jalapeno, and vegetable broth in a medium pot and bring to a boil. Lower to a simmer and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Carefully, transfer to a food processor/blender, add the cilantro and/or parsley, and salt, process until smooth. Set aside. You may need to process your verde sauce in two batches if using a food processor. (Note: See Salsa Verde for step by step instructions) Makes about 6 cups.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Enchilada filling: Warm the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, add the zucchini, carrots, corn, tomatoes, cumin, and salt, and saute until just tender, about 5 – 8 minutes.
Warm the tortillas: This helps to make them pliable. I prefer to warm mine over the stovetop so the edges get a little charred. Keep them stacked on each other with a towel over top to keep warm. Alternatively, wrap your corn tortillas in a dampened paper towel and microwave 45 seconds.
Assemble: Once everything is ready, start putting the enchilada’s together. Pour 1 cup of the sauce into the bottom of a 9 × 13 baking dish. Fill each tortilla with about 1/4 c of the vegetable mixture, a spoonful of black beans, roll up and place seam side down in the baking dish. Once filled, 2 – 3 cups of the remaining sauce on top of the enchiladas (use more if you like). Pour the cashew creama overtop. Cover with foil and bake 20 minutes. You may also like to leave the foil off for the last 10 minutes to let the exposed tortillas get a bit crispy. Add a finishing touch with fresh chopped cilantro overtop.

1 block (14 oz.) organic tofu (firm, extra or super firm)
1/2 of a fresh pineapple
1 red bell pepper
1 large zucchini
1 large red onion,

Pineapple-Teriyaki Sauce

1/2 cup coconut amino’s or low-sodium tamari or soy sauce
1/2 cup pineapple juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger or 1 teaspoon fresh grated
2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, coconut sugar or pure cane sugar, optional
2 T. tapioca powder or 1 T. cornstarch + equal amount of water


","

Instructions


Press tofu: Drain tofu and place between a clean double folded kitchen towel, or paper napkins. Place a medium stainless steel pot on top to help press the tofu, releasing it of excess moisture. If using super-firm tofu, skip this step. Let set while making the sauce. If using bamboo skewers, at this time you may also like to soak them in water to keep them from burning on the ends.
Make Sauce: In a small saucepan, add coconut amino’s/tamari, pineapple juice, garlic, ginger and optional sweetener, bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook on low for 1 minutes. In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch/tapioca powder with the water until smooth. Add the mixture to the teriyaki sauce and cook another minute, or until sauce thickens. Remove from heat, cover and set aside. If you like your teriyaki sauce on the sweeter side, add an extra tablespoon or two of your preferred sweetener. 
Prep tofu & veggies: Cut tofu into 3/4 – 1 inch cubes, place in a shallow baking dish and add about 1/3 – 1/2 of the sauce, gently toss to coat tofu, cover and let marinate for at least 30 minutes. Chop and prep the veggies. Thread tofu & veggies on the skewers, distributing evenly, in whatever order you like.
Grill: Turn on grill to medium high and coat with oil. Once grill is nice and hot, add skewers and cook, turning every so often, until tofu is slightly charred and vegetables are fork tender (or al dente if you prefer), about 8 minutes. Brush with a little sauce on the skewers while cooking if you like. Just be sure to save some for dipping later or adding over top of your grain.
Serve warm with grain of choice. I made a garlic cauliflower rice with chopped cilantro that was pretty darn good! This ginger cauliflower rice would be great too!
NOTES:
If you don’t have pineapple juice on hand, puree 1/2 cup of fresh pineapple and add enough water to equal 1/2 cup, mix well.

Instructions


This soup can be prepared 3 different ways:
Instant Pot:

Set Instant Pot to SAUTE and add the 1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water, onion, carrot, parsnip, and garlic, saute for 4 – 5 minutes (feel free to skip this step entirely adding everything to the pot and cooking).
Add split peas, herbs, bay leaves, and at least 5 cups of broth, and stir to combine.
Lock lid, set the valve to SEALING, and manually set to HIGH pressure for 15 minutes. Let natural release for 10 minutes. Remove bay leaves, stir in parsley, season to taste with salt and pepper.
Using an immersion blender, puree soup until desired consistency. Alternatively, use a blender or food processor (may take 2 – 3 batches).

Slow Cooker method:

Place ingredients into the bottom of your crock pot, starting with the split peas and finishing with the broth. Heat on low for 7 – 8 hours or high for 4 – 5 hours. Add parsley 30 minutes before done. Let soup cool slightly and remove bay leaves.
Using an immersion blender, puree soup until desired consistency. You can also puree using a food/processor or blender, may take two batches. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper as needed.

Stove top method:

In large pot or stock pot, heat oil or water and saute onion, garlic, carrots and parsnips until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. 
Add the split peas, herbs, bay leaves and vegetable broth.
Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.
Stir in the parsley 30 minutes before soup is done.
Let soup cool slightly and remove bay leaves.
Using an immersion blender, puree soup until desired consistency. Alternatively, use a food processor or blender, may take two batches. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper as needed.

Serve with whole grain or artisan bread. I just paired mine with some good seeded bread I had on hand and added some diced raw carrots on top which gave a nice freshness and crunch to the soup. Crumbled Coconut Bacon is also a nice topping!
Serves 4 – 6
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 – 6 days. For longer storage, keep in the freezer for up to 2 – 3 months.

Remove from molds: Let sit at room temp for a few moments. It should slide out easily or with a little pull. Alternately, place the popsicle maker in room temp water, letting it reach just under the brim of the pop maker. Do this just for a few seconds. Remove popsicles with a gentle pull.
Makes about 10 regular-sized popsicles 6 – 4.5 oz. popsicles.
Store: Store pops from the popsicle maker in an airtight container in the freezer. Place parchment or wax paper between the pops to keep them from sticking together. Pops made in dixie cups can easily be stored in their own container in the freezer (maybe in the door slot). They will last for about 3 – 4 weeks.

Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




1 medium Napa cabbage, about 2 lbs (savoy, green or any combo works too)
1/4 cup kosher, sea salt or other coarse salt
6 cups water
3/4 sweet apple (I used fuji), chopped
1/2 small white onion, chopped
1 1/2 inch ginger, chopped
1 – 2 cloves garlic
3 tablespoons Korean red chili powder (gochugaru) or 1 tablespoon each cayenne & Hungarian paprika
3 – 4 scallions (green onions), sliced 1 inch


","

Instructions


Preparing Cabbage: Quarter cabbage and chop laterally into about 2 inch pieces. Place cabbage in an extra large bowl or pot. Combine salt with 2 cups of lukewarm water, stir to dissolve salt. Pour salt water over the cabbage and add remaining 4 cups, stir to mix. If you can, place a plate or circular baking dish of sorts on top to submerge the cabbage (I used a pie dish), place something with a good amount of weight on top to hold down if necessary (it’s not completely necessary but will help to evenly wilt the cabbage). Give cabbage a good mix every now and then. Let soak for 2 hours, up to 12 if you like. I found that 2 – 4 hours was enough and didn’t see much change between the two times.
Make your seasonings: While cabbage is soaking, combine apple, onion, ginger and garlic in food processor/blender and process until fairly smooth.
In a small bowl, mix the chili pepper with a small amount of water to make a wet paste. You can just as easily blend it with the apple/onion mixture adding a couple tablespoons of water as well.
Mix everything together: Once cabbage is ready, drain water, reserving 1/2 cup, and rinse well. Place cabbage back in large bowl, combine with the scallions, apple/onion mixture and chili paste. Mix well to coat all pieces. Either use your hands (with gloves on pref to protect from the chili pepper) or simply use wooden spoons to toss everything.
Packing: Place the kimchi in glass jars or containers with lid, pack down the best you can to close air pockets and leave about an inch at the top for air and gases. Top with remaining juices, add reserved brine if needed to cover vegetables.
Fermenting: Let kimchi sit at room temp (or in a cool place like a pantry or closet if weather is extremely warm) for 24 – 36 hours. After 24 hours, open kimchi and pack the mixture down with a spoon (the cabbage will have likely shrunk and you’ll have more liquids). You may notice it bubbling, this is perfectly normal as the kimchi is fermenting. As your kimchi ferments the flavors will develop, taste every 24 hours and place kimchi in the refrigerator once you’re happy with the taste and to slow fermentation, usually after 36 – 48 hours. It should be tangy, spicy and slightly sweet. After moving to the fridge, it’s best used within a month, maybe two.
Makes about 3 – 4 cups
Serve with rice, use in Kimchi Fried Rice or make Kimchi Tofu Scramble!

1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 salt, or to taste

Instructions


Soak the cashews. I like to soak my cashews covered in hot water for 5 minutes. This helps them soften up nicely and blend into pure creamy perfect. To help with digestion, it’s recommended to soak them for up to 2 hours in cool water. Soaking can be optional.
Blend the ingredients. Add the cashews, 1/2 cup water, garlic, nutritional yeast, cumin, chili powder, and salt to the blender cup. Blend until creamy, about 1 – 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Add more water as needed. Taste for flavor.
Warm it up (optional). For a warm vegan queso, pour queso dip into an oven safe bowl, cover with tin foil, and place in a preheated oven set to 350 degrees F. for 10 – 15 minutes. Alternatively, warm in the microwave, uncovered, using 30 second intervals, stirring after each until warmed through.

1 cup raw cashews (if using soaked cashews, see notes)
3/4 cup water
2 – 4 garlic cloves
2 teaspoons dijon mustard
juice of 1/2 lemon
pinch of mineral salt, or to taste


","

Instructions


Place cashews, water, garlic, dijon, and juice of lemon in a blender and blend until creamy, about 45 seconds. Taste for flavor adding a little more of desired ingredients to taste.
Serve at room temperature.
Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.
Makes about 1 1/2 cups.
NOTES: 
Adjust the garlic to your taste. For a mild garlic flavor, 2 will do. If you love your garlic, use more.
To make this completely raw, use 3/4 – 1 teaspoon mustard powder in place of dijon.
For thinner aioli, add extra water, 1 – 2 tablespoons, at a time until desired consistency.
If you don’t care for dijon mustard, omit it all together. You can also start with 1 teaspoon, adding a little extra to taste.
For this task, I used a NutriBullet which does a great job blending cashews into pure creaminess. Plus, you can keep your aioli in the cup it was blended in, easily storing leftovers in the refrigerator.
Soaking cashews: If you prefer to soak your cashews, 2 hours before preparing the aioli, place cashews in a cup/bowl filled with water, covering cashews about 1 inch. Let set for 2 hours. For a quick soak, place cashews in a bowl of warm water for 1 hour, or in near boiling water for 15 minutes. Drain and rinse well before blending. Use 2/3 cup of water instead of 3/4 cup, as the cashews will have plumped up and you may not need as much. Add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time as needed to thin.
There are benefits to soaking your cashews, although I am sometimes lazy about it. It does help remove certain enzymes that may inhibit vitamin and mineral absorption, and also may help with digestion.

Instructions


FALAFELS
Chickpeas: If using dried chickpeas, place beans in a large pot and cover with at least two inches of water (they will puff up), let soak overnight or at least 12 hours. There is no need to cook them as they will soften enough to use in the recipe. If using canned chickpeas, be sure to drain and rinse well by running the beans under cool running water. If using freshly cooked chickpeas, you will need about 1 1/ 2 cups.
Preheat oven to 400. Coat your cast iron skillet or cookie sheet with olive oil.
Falafel mix: In a food processor/blender, combine all the ingredients for the falafel. Blend until blended and fairly smooth but not pureed, scraping down the sides as needed. 
Form falafels into whatever size you like:

Medium (shown above): Scoop 4 tablespoons per patty will yield approx. 6 patties.
Small: Scoop 1 heaping tablespoon per patty will yield approx. 9.
Mini nuggets: Scoop 1 heaping teaspoon will yield approx. 16.

Bake: Place on greased skillet/cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Flip and bake for 15 minutes. Total cooking time 25 minutes. If you find that your falafels are not as browned as you like, place them under the broiler for a minute or two. Just be sure to keep an eye on them so they don’t burn.
Store: Leftover falafels can be kept in an airtight container for 5 days. They will soften overnight. To warm them up and return crispness to the outside, place under broiler or in a toaster oven at a high temp for a minute or two while keeping an eye on them so they don’t burn.
DRESSING
While the patties are in the oven make your falafel dressing of choice.
Lemon Tahini Dressing: In a small bowl, combine all ingredients and mix until well combined. Taste for seasoning and add more water as needed 1 tablespoon at a time or add more lemon juice. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days.
OR, for something different and refreshing…
Avocado-Cucumber Dressing: In a food processor/blender, combine all the ingredients except for the water. Blend until smooth. Taste for seasoning. Add water a tablespoon or two at a time until desired consistency. Best chilled in the refrigerator before serving. Leftovers will hold up a day or two in a sealed container in the refrigerator. It may last a little longer but it’s gone by day two around my house.
ASSEMBLE SALAD
Once patties are ready, make your salad by layering leafy greens into individual bowls and top with falafels, cucumber, tomatoes, carrots, onion, and choice of dressing.

2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 medium lemon)
2 – 3 teaspoons apple cider vinegar (wine, rice, sherry or white balsamic ok too)
1 small clove garlic, chopped
pinch of red pepper flakes
good pinch of mineral salt


","

Instructions


Quinoa: In a medium saucepan, add quinoa and water/vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. Once done, remove lid and let rest for 10 minutes, fluff with fork.
Vinaigrette: Add all the ingredients to a small/personal food processor and blend until smooth and creamy. Alternately, you can chop the basil really well and mince the garlic, then simply mix all the ingredients together in a small container – or add the basil to the salad and mix the remaining vinaigrette ingredients together. Set aside to let the flavors come together. Taste again before mixing to adjust flavor. Keep in the refrigerator if making a day or two in advance.
Prep: If corn has husks, either remove them or pull away and tie (as in the pics above), and remove all the silk threads from underneath. Cut peaches along the seam all the way around and twist halves off the pit. Cut zucchini in half lengthwise. If you like add a light of oil to the cut side of the peaches and zucchini before placing on the grill, I didn’t do this since I oiled the grill directly.
Grill: Prep your grill and add a light coat of oil. Start with the corn first, it will take the longest, about 10 minutes or so depending on your grill. Then add the zucchini and peaches cut side down. The last two should grill up fairly quickly, about 3 – 5 minutes. I leave mine al dente.
Shuck & slice: Once done, remove the corn off the cob. Using a large, shallow, rimmed baking dish or pie dish, hold the corn by its top horizontally in the center, use a knife to gently but firmly cut the corn from the cob from top to bottom. Give the corn a 90 turn and repeat, until all the corn is removed. Slice zucchini into 1/4 – 1/2 inch slices. Slice peaches into 1/8 – 1/4 inch slices. Slice tomatoes in half. Slice avocado in half, twist to separate halves, remove seed and slice thinly.
Combine: Add quinoa to a large mixing bowl, along with the peaches, corn, zucchini, tomatoes, chickpeas, avocado and pepitas, toss to combine. Add the dressing and mix again. Add mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper to taste.
Serve at room temperature or chilled. Enjoy as is or with a handful of arugula (this is especially good!).
Serves 4 generously
NOTES:
Change up the chickpeas with edamame.
Make this oil-free by simply squeezing a lemon or two over top the salad, just be sure to add plenty of chopped basil. A little mint would be great too.
Use farro or wheat berries in place of quinoa for variety.
I wanted to add sliced, or diced, red onion and forgot, feel free to add in about 1/2 red onion.

Place cooked peas and potatoes in a colander, rinse gently and quickly with warm water, set aside. Leave bay leaves with the mix. Don’t worry about getting every pea out of the pot.
Saute veggies: In same pot, heat oil/water over medium heat, add bell peppers, jalapeno, onion, and thyme, saute for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove sauteed vegetables to the colander with the chana dal and potatoes, set aside. Don’t worry about getting every vegetable out of the pot.
Make soup base: In same pot, over medium heat, add flour and 1/3 cup of milk, whisk well until it thickens and lumps are barely visible, stirring continuously, slowly add in the remaining amount of liquids, stirring continuously, continue to heat over medium-low, lumps with dissolve completely as the liquid warms up. Careful to not boil or milk will begin to curdle. Continue to stir and heat until liquids begin to thicken about 7 –  10 minutes.

1386,https://simple-veganista.com/rosemary-almond-crackers/,Almond Flour Crackers,"


Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




2 tablespoons flaxseed meal
4 tablespoons water
1 cup almond flour or almond meal, packed
1/2 teaspoon salt

Optional add-ins:

1 tablespoon fresh or dried herbs (finely chopped) or flavor blend (I love Everything but the Bagel)
1 tablespoon sesame seeds


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Flax mixture: In a small bowl, mix the flaxseed meal and water. Set aside for 10 minutes, stirring every so often. The mixture will be gooey when ready. This is the binder for the mixture (and it includes healthy omega’s!).
Almond flour: You can buy almond flour or make it close enough at home. In a blender/food processor, grind 1 and 1/4 cup raw almonds into a fine powder or meal type consistency – it doesn’t have to be perfect, but the finer, the better.
Make the dough: In a medium-size bowl, combine the almond flour, flax mixture, salt, and optional seasonings.
Shape and roll: Form the dough into a ball and place it on a flat surface lined with parchment paper. Cover with another piece of parchment paper, press down with your hand to flatten and finish rolling with a pin to about 1/8 inch thick. The thinner, the better and more crispy the crackers will be. Remove top layer of paper.
Cut into squares: Using a pizza cutter or knife, cut squares or diagonals into whatever size you like. Using a toothpick or small fork, poke the center of each cracker to allow steam to escape during baking (so they don’t puff up). Top with a little coarse sea salt.
Bake: Line the baking sheet with the leftover parchment paper. Carefully transfer each cracker to the baking sheet and bake for 10 – 15 minutes. After the first 10 minutes, keep an eye on them, removing the ones around the edges that are done. They will ever so slightly darken and turn golden, you don’t want it too dark, or it may have a burnt flavor. When done, let cool.
Yields 50 – 1 inch – crackers, but your results may vary depending on how you cut them.
Store: Crackers can be stored in an airtight container for up to 7 days on the counter or in the pantry. For longer storage, keep in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Ingredients



Scale
1x2x3x 




16 oz. package pasta of choice (works with an 12oz package too)
paprika, garnish (optional)

For the crumb topping

two pieces of bread or 1 cup panko bread crumbs
1 tablespoon olive oil
generous pinch of salt

Cheese Sauce

2 cups raw cashews, soaked (see notes *)
2 cups water
1/4 – 1/2 cup nutritional yeast
juice of 1/2 large lemon or 2 teaspoons vinegar
1 clove garlic or 1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon white miso or 2 teaspoons dijon or 1 teaspoon mustard powder
2 teaspoons cornstarch or arrowroot (will help keep it creamy), optional
1 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
dash of cayenne, optional


","

Instructions


Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Pasta: Bring a large pot of water to a boil, cook your noodles and set aside.
Bread Crumbs: While waiting for the water to boil, start with your bread topping first. I toasted two pieces of bread we had on hand really well and processed them in the food processor until crumbly, a high speed blender will work too. Place the crumbs in a small bowl, drizzle with olive oil and a twist or two of the salt grinder, mix well and set aside. Quickly rinse the processor/blender bowl and move on to the cheese sauce.
Cheese sauce: In food processor/blender, combine all of the cheese sauce ingredients and blend until creamy. Add more water, a tablespoon or so at a time, and blend again. Taste for flavor adding anything extra to taste – salt, nutritional yeast, garlic.
Assemble: Once pasta is cooked and drained. Add pasta back to the pot it was cooked in, add the cheese sauce and combine well (you can also mix it together in the baking dish). In baking dish, pour mac & cheese and top with bread crumbs. 
Bake: Place in oven for 20 – 25 minutes, check after 15 minutes if crumbs are darkening too much for your liking, cover with foil. If your oven doesn’t brown the top very much (like mine didn’t), you can put it under the broiler for 5 minutes or so. Just keep an on it so the top doesn’t burn.
When done, let cool for about 10 minutes and serve. The sauce will thicken upon standing.
Serves 8
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 – 6 days.
