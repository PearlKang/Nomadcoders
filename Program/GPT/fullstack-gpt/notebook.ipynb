       "AIMessage(content=\"As a vegetarian chef, I can help you make a delicious Vegetarian Tikka Masala by replacing the chicken with a suitable alternative. Here's how you can modify the recipe:\\n\\nIngredients:\\n- 1 lb firm tofu, pressed and cut into bite-sized pieces (alternative to chicken)\\n- 1 cup plain yogurt or Greek yogurt (you can use dairy-free yogurt for a vegan option)\\n- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\\n- 2 teaspoons ground cumin\\n- 2 teaspoons paprika\\n- 1 teaspoon ground turmeric\\n- 1 teaspoon garam masala\\n- 1 teaspoon ground coriander\\n- 1 teaspoon chili powder (adjust to taste)\\n- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\\n- 1 onion, finely chopped\\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\\n- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\\n- 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes\\n- 1 cup coconut cream (alternative to heavy cream)\\n- Salt and pepper to taste\\n- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)\\n\\nInstructions:\\n1. Follow the same marinating process as the original recipe, but use tofu instead of chicken. Tofu can absorb flavors well, so marinate it for at least 1 hour for best results.\\n\\n2. Instead of baking the tofu, you can pan-fry it in a bit of oil until it's golden brown and slightly crispy.\\n\\n3. Proceed with the recipe as directed, replacing chicken with the pan-fried tofu.\\n\\n4. When adding the coconut cream, make sure to stir well and let it simmer to thicken the sauce.\\n\\n5. Garnish with chopped cilantro before serving.\\n\\nBy following these simple modifications, you can enjoy a flavorful Vegetarian Tikka Masala that stays true to the essence of the traditional dish. Enjoy your meatless meal!\")"
