      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces\n",
      "- 1 cup plain yogurt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon ginger, minced\n",
      "- 1 can (14 oz) tomato sauce\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon garam masala\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground cumin\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon ground coriander\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon paprika\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)\n",
      "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",

      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. In a bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, half of the minced garlic, half of the minced ginger, and a pinch of salt. Add the chicken pieces and mix well to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers and place them on a baking sheet lined with foil. Bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and slightly charred.\n",

      "\n",
      "Instructions:\n",

      "2. Instead of baking the paneer, you can pan-fry or grill it until slightly browned and cooked through.\n",
      "3. Proceed with the recipe as directed, starting with sautéing the onion, garlic, and ginger in vegetable oil.\n",
      "4. Add the tomato sauce and spices to the skillet and simmer to develop the flavors.\n",
      "5. Add the cooked paneer to the sauce and simmer for a few more minutes to allow the paneer to absorb the flavors.\n",
      "6. Serve the Paneer Tikka Masala over rice or with naan bread, garnished with chopped cilantro.\n",
