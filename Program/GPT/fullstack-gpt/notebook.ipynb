      "3. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-10 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic.\n",
      "4. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.\n",
      "5. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).\n",
      "6. Punch down the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place the loaf on a greased baking sheet or in a greased loaf pan.\n",
      "7. Cover the loaf with a clean towel and let it rise for another 30-45 minutes.\n",
      "8. Bake the bread in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until it is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n",
      "9. Let the bread cool before slicing and serving. Enjoy! \n",
