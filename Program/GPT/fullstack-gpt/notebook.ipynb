       "AIMessage(content='Victory Mansions is a run-down apartment building in London, the chief city of Airstrip One in George Orwell\\'s novel \"1984.\" The building is dilapidated, with peeling paint, broken elevators, and flickering lights. The hallway smells of boiled cabbage and old rag mats, and a colored poster of an enormous face with the caption \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\" is tacked to the wall. The flat is located seven flights up, with a faulty lift that rarely works. The building lacks basic amenities and is part of an economy drive in preparation for Hate Week, with the electric current being cut off during daylight hours. Surrounding Victory Mansions are grimy landscapes, rotting nineteenth-century houses, bombed sites with rubble, and sordid colonies of wooden dwellings. The building symbolizes the oppressive and impoverished living conditions under the totalitarian regime of the Party in the novel.')"
